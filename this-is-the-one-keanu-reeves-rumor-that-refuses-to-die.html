His relationship with Alexandra Grant; people <a href=#>may have suspected their coupledom</a> for years, but it wasn't confirmed until Keanu finally debuted his leading lady on a red carpet.</p><p>Other aspects of his celebrity are similarly tough to discern. Like which roles he'll wind up playing, or what film franchises he'll agree to revive. It's not so much that he's purposely keeping things a secret, though. Sometimes, Keanu himself likes the rumors that start, even if they don't ever come to fruition.</p><h2 id=fans-bugged-keanu-to-embrace-one-rumor>Fans Bugged Keanu To Embrace One Rumor</h2><p>Ages ago, a rumor began that Keanu Reeves was going to play Doctor Strange. Seven years ago, in a Reddit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AMA</a>, a fan wrote to Keanu that there were a lot of rumors about him taking on the role. Interestingly, Keanu responded that he had "just recently" heard about the rumor, and it kind of intrigued him.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>One Fan Who Dated Him Says This Is What Keanu Reeves Is Really Like In Person</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Around that same time, in fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keanu gave an interview</a> with Screen Rant where he admitted that he didn't know much about Doctor Strange, but that he planned to "go check it out." When the interviewer confirmed that duh, Keanu would be a great fit for the magical role, Keanu responded that he liked "that kind of stuff."</p><p>So when a Redditor elaborated that Keanu becoming Doctor Strange would make them happy, the actor said he'd have to call his agent.</p><h2 id=the-rumor-never-died-and-might-come-true>The Rumor Never Died (And Might Come True)</h2><p>What's interesting about this Doctor Strange rumor is that it literally never died, and six years later, in 2020, plenty of headlines were still spouting the potential for Keanu to join the MCU. If Keanu himself hasn't vetoed the suggestion, fans reason, maybe it will eventually happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only problem is that it seems like Keanu would be perfect for a handful of other roles, too, according to fans. Some say <a href=#>Keanu should play an entirely different character</a>, while he himself has said <a href=#>he would have liked to play Wolverine</a>.</p><p>Either way, fans were hopeful that Keanu would eventually find his perfect fit in the MCU, with many Redditors joking about making headlines like 'Redditors convince Keanu Reeves to take movie role.' It's not too far-fetched, though, because Keanu is a man of the people.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's Why Some Fans Are Confused About Keanu Reeves' Fame</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinpmeqnqzscSvnKxloqq6sL6MrZ%2BarF2nsqfB0p6qZqyfYrGqsYymmKuulaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
