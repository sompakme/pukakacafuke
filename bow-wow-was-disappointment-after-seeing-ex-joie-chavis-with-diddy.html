We handled it the way we was supposed to handle it. There’s a conduct and code men go by and everyone knows certain things are off limits.

The f**k wrong with you? N***a, you know we don’t associate with no clown s**t. You Bow, n***a.&nbsp;You better understand your brand and get out here and go to work. C’mon, man.
