They were first publicly linked when they shared a selfie together on Instagram in June 2021, and later seemingly confirmed their relationship status by posting a kissing selfie in November.</p><p>There are few details available about the ring Jake used to propose to Millie, but it’s estimated to be worth a small fortune. Jessica Flinn-Allen, CEO of wedding and <a href=#>engagement ring specialists Jessica Flinn</a>, estimates the ring is easily worth over $300,000 USD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“From what we can see in Millie’s Instagram photo, we’re guessing that the ring is valued in the region of £200,000 to £250,000,” the ring specialist explained.</p><p>“The ring is a cushion-cut solitaire 4ct diamond ring, and potentially a hugging halo on a polished band,” she added.</p><p>In November 2022, Millie was asked during an interview how she met Jake, and she replied that it was online. Moreover, the pair were only friends first after meeting. “<a href=#>We met on Instagram</a>, and we were friends for a bit, and then, what can I say?” she shared.</p><p>Millie isn’t the only star to recently announce their engagement by showing off a huge wedding ring. Earlier this month, Lana Del Rey was wearing a diamond on her wedding finger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Millie’s ring, Jessica Flinn estimated that Lana’s <a href=#>diamond could be worth around $300,000</a>.</p><p>“The engagement ring is a traditional and timeless setting style, a three-stone ring in white metal, most likely platinum,” she said of the sparkler. “The ring features a large, round diamond in the centre, flanked by two smaller round-cut diamonds on either side, creating a symmetrical and elegant design.”</p><p>“The side stones on Lana Del Rey's engagement ring not only add to the symmetry and overall beauty of the ring, but they also serve an important purpose in enhancing the sparkle and brilliance of the centre stone,” she added.</p><p>If one thing is for sure, both of these engagement rings are stunning.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> Jennifer Lopez Faces Intense Backlash After Launching Alcohol Brand</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Jessica Flinn</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8maop5lkqS7qLXOr6BmqKKkvbC%2FxKxkraddoratuMieZJunkpfGbq7RqK6nZaeewal5kmlnaWhgYrGqrcyopZ1lop67qHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
