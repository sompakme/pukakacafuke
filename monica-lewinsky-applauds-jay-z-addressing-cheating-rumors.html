Having been called out publicly by his wife in her fierce 2016 album and video, <i>Lemonade,</i> Jay-Z knew that his fans wouldn’t have blinked if his next album skimmed past the allegations. That’s not uncommon for men to do,” she <a href=#>wrote in the story </a>published on Wednesday July 19. “And it’s not as if we hadn’t seen Beyoncé and Jay-Z out in the world together since then — not to mention, welcoming their twins to planet Earth. Jay-Z could have ignored it all.”</p><p>The activist, 43, added that Jay-Z’s addressing rumors on the album will “move the conversation forward and help others.”</p><p><a href=#>The music mogul rapped about his </a>rumored marital strife throughout the album, which was released in June on Tidal.

A man that don’t take care his family can’t be rich,” he raps.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Lewinsky had previously called out Beyoncé for a lyric on the Grammy winner’s 2013 song “Partition,” in which the star sings, “He Monica Lewinsky’d all on my gown.” In an interview with <i>Vanity </i><i>Fair </i>the next year, Lewinsky was quick to correct the line.</p><p>“Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we’re verbing,” Lewinsky <a href=#>said at the time</a>, “I think you meant ‘Bill Clinton’d’ all on my gown,’ not ‘Monica Lewinsky’d.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamp56esKJ5y56uoqajoMZurc%2Bpo5qtlKh6q63YZrFmmZSZv6a%2F0qKloGWTnbKiwMinnmaqpaK8s7%2BMsGtya2NpgnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
