Then, in the following scene, Margaret confides in her husband, Joe Benigno that she still fails to see why asking questions should come across as such an offense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WIth two such different viewpoints, a serious confrontation seems imminent - though we doubt anyone could have predicted just how explosively it would play out!</p><h2 id=night-one-in-nashville-becomes-dinner-and-a-showdown>Night One In Nashville Becomes Dinner And A Showdown</h2><p>Aside from small digs at one another and underhanded comments in their confessionals, the Nashville trip starts off relatively calm...but a dinner out proves to be all Teresa needs to confront Margaret, and from there, everything takes a turn for the worse.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>RHONJ Season 12 Episode 8 Review: 'Forest Of Fury'</a></span></p><p>After one too many people comes up to greet Margaret while they're out, Teresa points out that her friend-turned-foe seems to know <strong>"everyone,"</strong> and as such, it only makes sense that she suspects her of planting the rumors that continue to plague Louie.</p><p>This prompts Margaret to lash out at Teresa, calling her <strong>"a disgusting liar," </strong>and just like that, the match is lit, and everything Teresa has held in over the course of the season culminates in her getting physical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of labelling Margaret <strong>"white trash,"</strong> Teresa throws her food at Margaret, stunning everyone in attendance.</p><p>After initially storming out, Teresa attempts to return to the table to continue her attack. However, ultimately, she's taken back to the vacation rental, where she promptly packs up her things and leaves to find alternative accommodation.</p><p>As for Margaret's response to the situation, she begins by calling Teresa <strong>"a thug and an animal."</strong></p><h2 id=dolores-urges-margaret-to-drop-the-questions-and-margaret-stirs-the-pot-again>Dolores Urges Margaret To Drop The Questions And Margaret Stirs The Pot Again</h2><p>In the wake of the attack, Dolores pleads with Margaret to stop asking questions about Louie, pointing out that even if she does have concerns, Teresa isn't <strong>"receiving"</strong> what she has to say, so it would be best to put the situation to bed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dolores also points out that, as a Gorga, Teresa <strong>"can handle anything"</strong> - even if any of what Louie has been accused of is true.</p><p>However, Margaret simply doubles down on what she's been saying all along, and quips, <strong>"if</strong> [their relationship] <strong>is the real deal, she wouldn't act this way."</strong></p><h2 id=fans-react-to-the-explosive-rhonj-fight>Fans React To The Explosive 'RHONJ' Fight</h2><p>It appears that among RHONJ fans, most are team Teresa in this altercation. In fact, while many have said they didn't agree with Teresa's particular actions, Margaret was in no position to <strong>"play the victim"</strong> - many referencing instances in the past where she's thrown drinks on others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still others were quick to point out that Margaret had been relentless in her attempts to disparage Louie's character, so Teresa's reaction was simply a matter of time.</p><p>Whether or not there's any coming back from this remains to be seen, and we'll have to stay tuned to find out where the former friends go from here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing we do know, however, is that the drama is back in full swing, this season of RHONJ!</p><p>Fans can catch new episodes of <strong>Real Housewives of New Jersey </strong>anytime, anywhere on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>hayu</strong></a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Things Take A Wholesome Turn On The Latest Real Housewives Of New Jersey</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaeen3q0scCspqdlYWd6przIrKadnV1mfm6%2BxK%2Bgnq9do7aotNOmmKudXZ67brrArJ%2BvnZeWwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
