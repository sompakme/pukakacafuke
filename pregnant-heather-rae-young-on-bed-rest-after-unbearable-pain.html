I am not doing very good.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> star explained: “The sciatica pain is just unbearable, worse than before, so she wants me resting, laying down.”</p><p>The <a href=#>California native</a>, who is expecting her first child with husband <a href=#><strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong></a>, noted in her social media post that the doctor wants her on “bed rest for now.”</p><p>Heather confessed that <a href=#>the order is “hard” for her</a>, but she is taking the advice seriously.</p><p>“Obviously, most important thing is feeling better, taking care of the baby,” she said, revealing that her delivery date is “getting close but there’s still some time, so I have to do what’s best.”</p><p>The real estate agent noted in a second social media post on Thursday that her stepson, Brayden, was lifting her spirits while at home. The <a href=#>Flip or Flop</a> alum, 41, shares <a href=#>Brayden, 7, and daughter Taylor, 12</a>, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Christina Hall</strong></a> (née Haack).</p><p>“He just lights up my day,” Heather wrote via her Instagram Story alongside picture of her stepson cuddling with their dog. “Comes in the room to check on me to make sure I’m feeling OK.”</p><p>The Netflix personality — <a href=#>who married the HGTV star in October 2021</a> — debuted her baby bump in July.</p><p>Earlier this month, Heather <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> how her pregnancy has brought her closer to both Tarek and his children.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They’re so excited. Every week, Brayden likes to look at my app and see where we’re at, what size the baby is,” she said while attending the 2022 People’s Choice Awards. “They’re really involved with picking the name. They’re just so excited.”</p><p>While both Brayden and Taylor had input in naming <a href=#>their future step sibling</a>, Heather told Us that the moniker “has not been set” yet.</p><p>“We actually haven’t finalized the name, we don’t know completely,” the Newport Beach, California, resident confessed. “We’re kind of throwing around ideas, but I think we want to wait until he’s born and see what he looks like.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602afnpmknbKzedGanGaxn6q7qHnOp2SbnZRiv6a%2F02aYn6yVp3q2usGemKuZkqGybrzAoqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
