But she was hoping to earn even more when a judge determined a permanent figure, as Christine’s legal team was arguing she should receive $248,000 per month, which Kevin says he’s unable to do so since leaving Yellowstone.</p><p>During a child support hearing in California that spanned two days, commencing on August 31, the former couple revisited their shared history. In the course of these proceedings, Christine brought up their long-standing tradition of hosting extravagant Christmas gatherings on a vast 10-acre property adjacent to their shared residence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple would coordinate the delivery of a remarkable 40 tons of snow for their holiday festivities, transforming the area into a winter wonderland. Additionally, they would create a Nativity scene complete with animals that children could ride. To enhance the festive ambiance, they constructed toboggan trails amid the property's fir trees.</p><p>Moreover, Christine disclosed that they also utilized the same property to host camping-themed birthday parties for their 15-year-old son, Cayden, which included dozen of luxury tents and even taco food trucks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the elaborate descriptions of Kevin and Christine's extravagant parties may appear unrelated to a custody hearing, Christine's legal team aimed to establish that their children were accustomed to a lavish lifestyle. Consequently, they asserted that Christine should receive a higher child support payment to maintain the standards to which the children are accustomed. Ultimately, however, the judge disagreed.</p><p><a href=#>Kevin has since spoken out following the court’s ruling</a> to express that there’s no animosity between him and his estranged wife. Walking out of the courthouse on Friday, Kevin told reporters, "Were you laughing? I wasn't. This is a horrible place to be, but this is where we're at."</p><p>"It feels so bad," he continued. "We're talking about somebody I love on the other side."</p><p>He furthermore said he “still has love” for Christine, and believes “everyone” is hoping that their divorce drama will be resolved soon.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kroy Biermann Files Request To Sell Georgia Mansion ASAP Amid Divorce From Kim Zolciak</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4psLIp2Scp6Opu6a%2BjLCgp6tdl7aoecinZJygmaGxbr%2FUqaeoqqRisKK%2FxGaYrGWVrXq4tcWeZKCdpKh6onnFq5icrJmku267xWauoZmkYsCpsYyaqqSdlGKzsL6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
