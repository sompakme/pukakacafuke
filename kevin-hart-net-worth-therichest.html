His career got off to a rocky start, as he was repeatedly booed off the stage. Following those initial failures, Hart continued competing in comedy competitions throughout Massachusetts, and audience reactions to his performances gradually improved.</p><p>Hart had to work hard to develop his own comedic style. After attempting to imitate comedians such as Chris Tucker at first, he finally discovered his own rhythm by delving into his insecurities and life experiences.
