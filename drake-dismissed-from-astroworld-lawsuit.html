On April 8 and 10, Judge Kristen Hawkins responded to motions for dismissal filed by various individuals and companies named as defendants. According to the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Houston Chronicle</a>, Drake is officially now removed from the suit, but a handful of other defendants got their requests denied.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Hotline Bling” rapper was named in the legal documents because he appeared as guest during the festival, which ended in a deadly crowd crush. The judge has decided to dismiss all claims against Drake with prejudice on the basis that he did not have control over the security or safety measures during the event.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, the Harris County judge has denied requests by Apple Inc., <a href=# id=auto-tag_travis-scott data-tag=travis-scott>Travis Scott</a>, and two of his companies to be removed as defendants. In Scott’s filing, his attorneys claimed, “Performers are not expected to render special protection to the audience, nor to safeguard them from the rest of the crowd.” His attorneys argued that the “Goosebumps” creator was not personally responsible for the safety of attendees.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In Apple’s March 11 filing, the attorneys denied involvement in the concert’s planning, stating its role was “limited to Travis Scott’s performance, which was just one of many during the two-day event.” Apple also criticized the plaintiffs’ “lack of evidence” to support their claim.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Epic Records, Travis Scott’s record label, Darryl Platt, Eighteentwentysix LLC, Epic Records, ParaDocs Worldwide Inc, Re:Source Event Group, Scoremore LLC, and Scoremore MGMT LLC were reportedly also dismissed from the litigation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In related news, Aubrey Graham has been making headlines throughout March and April thanks to Furture and<a href=#> Kendrick Lamar’s recent “Like That” record,</a> which contained a diss verse from the latter aimed at Drizzy and J. Cole. On the song, K. Dot references the duo’s latest collaboration, “First Person Shooter,” claims he’s in a class of his own, and more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“N**gas clickin’ up, but cannot be legit, no 40 Water, tell ’em/ Ah, yeah, huh, yeah, get up with me/ F**k sneak dissin’, first-person shooter, I hope they came with three switches,” Lamar raps.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">J. Cole has officially bowed out of the beef, as he recently issued a<a href=#> 4-minute-long apology </a>during his headlining set at Dreamville Festival last week. However, fans are eagerly waiting for Drake to take the next step. In the meantime, revisit “Like That” below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">D</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m%2ForfEZpuiq52ewLSxw2adq6edYq60wNGorqiqnJl6ra3WrKyirF1mf3SAl29wbG1iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
