Billion dollar budgets and special effects are all good and well, but you want those multiple consecutive backflips to be real. Seeing an actress use kung fu&nbsp;to take down her opponent one lighting-speed whip at a time makes it so much more authentic. There literally is nothing more disappointing than watching some A-lister blast through windows, only to find that pics of her stunt double have gone viral.</p><p>A decent amount of male actors are known for doing their own stunt work. Hugh Jackman was the real deal in Wolverine.&nbsp;Avengers star Chris Evans only turned to Robert Downey Jr. when he was injured. Jason Statham, Christian Bale, and Tom Cruise all join them. But what about the fierce girls?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of these actresses are pushing their bodies to the physical limits. Diva demands are off-limits when you have 15lb of pure muscle to gain. In movies, that require protein shakes through the night. Forget beauty sleep. 10 of these actresses are so boss that they've pulled some of the most fearsome stunts in history. These other 10, though, are definitely using body doubles. From Suicide Squad to Wonder Woman and beyond, here are 10 Hollywood ladies who are the real deal (and 10 who had to hire a fake).</p><h2 id=gal-gadot-two-years-as-a-combat-soldier><strong>GAL GADOT: TWO YEARS AS A COMBAT SOLDIER</strong></h2><p>Gal Gadot is all kinds of awesome. The Israeli model and actress was a total unknown before joining the Fast & Furious franchise, and whoever is in charge of casting over at Wonder Woman chose well. But Gal isn't just a pretty face. Israeli women must serve two full years in the military–&nbsp;one of the few countries in the world that demands that from its citizens. Gal served for two years as an enlisted soldier, specializing as a combat instructor. Her weapons knowledge and real-life experience was a huge appeal to the Fast & Furious producers, and Gal has spoken out about why she feels she was such a good fit. Gal Gadot was a combat instructor for two years as an enlisted soldier in the Israeli military. "The director really liked&nbsp;that," Gal said. "He wanted me to use my knowledge of weapons. The adrenaline was just incredible."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing, Gal said, "You give two or three years, and it's not about you. You learn discipline and respect. All of the stunts on Fast 5 and Fast 6, I have done myself." The Israeli military is reportedly one of the toughest in the world. According to The Daily Mail, one soldier loses their life every year from the exhaustion of training alone, and those two years are no joke. Morning showers are ice cold to keep the soldiers on their toes, and they start out by being sent to run in the desert with 80lb on their backs. They have to run until their supervisor says "stop." Wonder Woman,&nbsp;indeed.</p><h2 id=emilia-clarke-daenerys-double><strong>EMILIA CLARKE: DAENERYS DOUBLE</strong></h2><p>Sorry to burst your bubble. The fighting pits of Meereen may be full of action, but they're full of something else&nbsp;– a whole lot of stunt doubles. Emilia Clarke exploded onto the Hollywood scene as Game of Thrones' stunning blonde, Khaleesi. While Emilia owns her character, she isn't the one jumping on the dragons. The producers didn't have to look far to find Emilia's double, though. Time to meet Rosie Mac, a.k.a. the Khaleesi you never knew existed. Elle interviewed Rosie all about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"By coincidence, I had uploaded a selfie with a similar hairstyle to Khaleesi, and an agent picked it up." Emilia Clarke's Game of Thrones doppelgänger&nbsp;is the creepily similar-looking Rosie Mac.</strong></p><p>Rosie's striking resemblance to Emilia's silver-haired character was too much for the producers to turn down, though. To be fair, that show doesn't mince its words when it calls itself "fantasy." Daario Naharis (Michiel Huisman) has a double, and we hate to break it to you – the season five finale was no different. Being forced by the High Sparrow across the streets of the King's Landing was gruesome, but Lena Headey has her double, Rebecca Van Cleave to thank for that Emmy nomination. "Moments when I got all kinds of stuff thrown at me, with the chamber pots being dumped out," were the "hardest parts," Rebecca told EW.</p><h2 id=scar-jo-combat-training><strong>SCAR JO: COMBAT TRAINING</strong></h2><p>Scarlett Johansson is no doormat. The pint-sized actress has climbed the ranks to become the biggest superhero of 2018, and it's hard not to think of Captain America without picturing that red-headed silhouette. Scarlett has openly admitted that the most dangerous stunts in her Iron Man 2 and Captain America roles were performed by a double, but make no mistake – ScarJo pushes herself. Hand-to-hand combat and weapons training were a daily deal for Scarlett's prep, and that was after the gruelling 90-minute workouts – seven days a week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"That woman hanging 60 feet in the air, taking punches and throwing punches? Well, that's me. I work out like a dude," Scarlett said. ScarJo has pulled her own stunts in Iron Man 2 and her Black Widow roles, although the most extreme are&nbsp;left to a professional.</strong></p><p>That professional comes by the name of Heidi Moneymaker – neat fact: Heidi has been the double for Michelle Rodriguez, Jaime Pressly, and even Frankie Muniz. Speaking to Shape about Scarlett, Heidi said, "Scarlett did a lot of her own fights, and any time she had the opportunity to try a stunt, she did." Scarlett was also asked about how and when she sets her own limits. "Please don't think I'm stupid," ScarJo said. "I know my limitations. Four cartwheels 20 feet in the air – it's my stunt double. The fights, though? All real."</p><h2 id=natalie-portman-black-swan-scandal><strong>NATALIE PORTMAN: BLACK SWAN SCANDAL</strong></h2><p>Remember Natalie Portman in the psychological thriller, Black Swan? Aside from giving us an epic plot, that movie really showed the world how tough ballet is. Fluttering around in a tutu might look dainty and delicate, but the reality behind it is literally blood, sweat, and tears. Ballerinas train for over ten years in full-time academies, and the extremes they put their bodies through are insane. Dancing "en pointe," involves putting your entire body weight on one toe, and it's not uncommon for ballerinas to leave the stage with blood-filled shoes. Swan Lake is considered the most-challenging role for ballerinas – the 42 double whip "fouetté" turns the dancer has to do come at the END of a three-hour performance. Seriously, YouTube that word.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Natalie Portman preferred a body double for the blood-filled shoes that ballet dancing leads to. "I did all the dancing," her body double, said. Sarah Lane of the American Ballet Theater was chosen for the hard work. The result was a huge scandal.</p><p>According to EW, Sarah felt that she'd been "the victim of a cover-up." Of the full body shots, Sarah said that only 5% were truly Natalie. Meanwhile, Natalie had given an interview, saying "I do have a double for complicated turning stuff." Er, there was more to your role than the spins, Natalie...</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-not-just-a-pretty-face><strong>ANGELINA JOLIE: NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE</strong></h2><p>Despite all the negative press Angelina Jolie has received following her 2017 divorce from Brad Pitt, you can't hate on Angie when it comes to her movies. From the early days of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, through to Wanted and Maleficient, Angelina is an A-lister who puts her money where her mouth is. Angelina reportedly refused to even consider a stunt double for spy thriller, Salt. Despite Maleficient being a Disney movie, Angie was 100% real when her character was suspended from a wire before being thrown back into the air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Angelina's trainer has said that the actress performs 99% of her own stunts. "My stunt team tell me to go off that bridge." For Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Angelina took on bodybuilding and full training.</strong></p><p>We watch action movies for the suspense ramp-up and the epic fight scenes. Cars zooming at a million miles an hour or heroes toeing high ledges are there to have us on the edge of our seats, and with Angie, it's 100% real. From jumping off a bridge onto a moving truck, to balancing on 12-storey high ledges, Angelina is "absolutely fearless," according to Salt's stunt coordinator.</p><h2 id=j-lo-her-double-is-a-man><strong>J-LO: HER DOUBLE IS A MAN</strong></h2><p>Well, this is kind of embarrassing. There's no arguing that Jennifer Lopez is every inch herself during her energetic dance routines, but this should be a warning: stick to your strengths. Apparently not satisfied with her super-lucrative music career and reported $18 million American Idol fee according to People, J-Lo has also branched into acting. As an actress,&nbsp;Jennifer is generally considered to be surprisingly good. Her roles in The Wedding Planner and Maid In Manhattan saw Jen deliver humor, while Enough gave us more harrowing performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>J-Lo writes songs called "I'm Real." Her stunt double in her "Follow The Leader" music video was actually a man. Jenny From The Block also used a double for Shades of Blue.</strong></p><p>The similarities here are definitely spot-on. The braided hair, all-black costume, and facial structure are eerily similar. Jen's cop drama, Shades of Blue has some pretty hands-on action, although The Daily Mail reported that&nbsp;Jennifer&nbsp;wasn't doing all that much on-set. Strolling around arm-in-arm with A-Rod and "sipping coffees" is the most that&nbsp;she is said to have been doing when the couple was photographed in 2016. Come on, Jen. We know you work out. Is it so hard to make an effort?</p><h2 id=j-law-the-hunger-games-stunts-were-all-her><strong>J-LAW: THE HUNGER GAMES&nbsp;STUNTS WERE ALL HER</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Lawrence is an actress who delivers the full package. The Hunger Games&nbsp;star might grace red carpets looking a million dollars, but getting into warrior shape for her movies is Jennifer's priority. Our favorite feisty heroine Katniss Everdeen was 100% real in The Hunger Games– the most that movie's stunt crew did for Jen was teach her rock scaling, tree jumping, and log jumping. Behind the glitz and the glam, this is an actress who can get into shape for a movie in just six weeks. When J-Law lays down the law, she lays down the law.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jennifer Lawrence pulled every rock-scaling, tree-jumping, and archery stunt in The Hunger Games. Six weeks of intense training twice a day was her preparation, and her water stunt even left her deaf in one ear for six days.</strong></p><p>"We were doing a water stunt and I had to jump in this water with all these jets. I was deaf for like six days," Jennifer told Vogue.&nbsp;Just like Jen dieted for X Men: First Class, she trained with a top conditioning coach for The Hunger Games. Her rigorous training included archery and movement basics, agility drills, plus speed and running training. Watch out for Red Sparrow, though. Jennifer's ballet scene is graciously performed by American Ballet Theater superstar, Isabella Boylston.</p><h2 id=january-jones-needs-her-double><strong>JANUARY JONES:&nbsp;NEEDS HER DOUBLE</strong></h2><p>January Jones is at her most comfortable on the set of retro TV show, Mad Men. Her role as Betty Draper is polished, poised, and absolutely perfect for the 60s suburbia setting. January actually deserves a bit of respect here – piling on the pounds for a role is something actresses dread. Charlize Theron and Renee Zellweger have literally stuffed their faces to "fatten up" for their respective Monster's Ball and Bridget Jones movies. A little less real, January told Jimmy Fallon that her Mad Men prosthetic suit "took six hours to get into." It's time to move over to X-Men: First Class, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>January Jones opted for a "second class" body double in X-Men: First Class. Her interviews say: "I was nearly decapitated by the stunt wires," although January did admit that "my double did a lot of the harder stuff."</p><p>"Emma Frost, my X-Men character has an impossible body," January told MTV. "In the amount of time I had to train, it just wasn't possible to achieve that amount of muscle without losing all the good bits. As Emma Frost, I'm telepathic. I can turn into a diamond, which means I'm very, very cold." Given this picture, though, January is also very dependent on her double.</p><h2 id=chloe-grace-moretz-she-fully-commits><strong>CHLOE GRACE MORETZ:&nbsp;SHE FULLY COMMITS</strong></h2><p>The offers are pouring in for Chloe Grace Moretz. Why? Well, when you're an awesome actress who's willing to pull your own stunts, people are interested. Chloe started out young, although her true break-through was in the aptly named 2010 movie, Kick-Ass. If you think this actress was shying away from the action, think again. A teenage Chloe trained with Jackie Chan's stunt crew to pull as many of her fight scenes as possible. Chloe has continued to pull her own action scenes in Kick-Ass 2 and The 5th Wave, for which she spoke to Arts & Culture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I usually train pretty heavily for the stunts I do in movies," Chloe said. "When I came to do 5th Wave, they didn't want me to look trained. They wanted me to look like I was fumbling around with a gun, and that was kind of hard because I've trained so much in the past."</strong></p><p>For most actresses, it's the reverse. They sign that multi-million dollar contract and – at a push, they might brave some Jiu Jitsu or the odd jump. Chloe actually found it really weird to be "reminded to stumble and fall now and then hold the gun in the wrong way."</p><h2 id=emma-watson-double-trouble><strong>EMMA WATSON: DOUBLE TROUBLE</strong></h2><p>Emma Watson has a lot to be proud of. The Harry Potter actress couldn't have been more perfect to play the goody two-shoes, Hermione Granger. Starring in one of the biggest movie franchises of all time will also get you rich– Emma's Harry Potter earnings total a sweet $60 million, according to Forbes. The British actress was juggling her studies at Brown University during later films though, and apparently, it was the "conflicting schedules" that made the producers cast a body double for Emma. Convenient excuse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"She wasn't there a lot, really. We had to shoot around her," co-star Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) said. "She had a lot of doubles. They made a mask of Emma's face, a prosthetic for wider shots."</strong></p><p>We're not sure how well that sits with us. To hire a stunt double for quadruple air flips while explosions propel you 80 feet in the air is one thing. Hiring a body double because you're too busy with other things to even turn up is slightly more questionable. Hermione's role wasn't exactly "action," although the Whomping Willow isn't something we'd want to cross without some physical training. Here's Emma and her double. Professor Dumbledore would be shaking his head...</p><h2 id=margot-robbie-literal-squad-goals><strong>MARGOT ROBBIE: LITERAL SQUAD GOALS</strong></h2><p>Here's something refreshing. An "it" girl who isn't just famous for frolicking the streets of New York City sipping iced lattes while she "hits the gym" in tight leggings. Margot Robbie is an actress with a serious skillset. To be fair, she had a good head start. Starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf Of Wall Street is going to get you noticed, but the Suicide Squad actress is more than makeup and tattoos. This daredevil had an on-set double for back-up, but both producers, Richard Suckle and Andy Horwitz have gone on the record stating that Margot did all of her own stunt work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Margot Robbie's Suicide Squad body double "sat in a chair and watched," according to the movie's producers. Margot trained for the Harley Quinn role for two whole years to get into fighting form.</strong></p><p>It's full steam ahead for Margot, who (yet again) is pulling her own stunts in I, Tonya. Figure skater and choreographer, Sarah Kawahara trained Margot to skate from scratch over many weeks. "She really had to learn," Margot's trainer told Refinery29. "Not only to skate on figure skates, but also Tonya's body language. It's hard to capture that. Tonya was very athletic." Clearly, it was a perfect match.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-she-is-no-angelina-in-the-stunt-department><strong>MEGAN FOX: SHE IS NO ANGELINA IN THE STUNT DEPARTMENT</strong></h2><p>Talk about a "transformation." Megan Fox is used to turning heads on account of her good looks and Angelina Jolie-esque vibe. But make no mistake, this actress has her limits. The Transformers star made everyone do a double take with this pic, taken from the set of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in 2013. Two of Megan Fox might be better than one to some, but it's always a bit disappointing when you learn that an actress has used a double. This is Megan with Stacey Carino – a woman who deserves a little attention. Stunt doubles are literally the underdog of the movie industry, and some are paid as little as $5000 a year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Megan Fox used stunt doubles for both Transformers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Her double, Stacey Carino has stepped in for a string of high-profiles roles, including many CSI episodes. For her stunt work in Star Trek: Enterprise, Stacey received no credit.</strong></p><p>Megan seemed very at ease in a string of pictures taken by The Daily Mail as she frolicked on the set of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Sure, she looks great. The edgy yellow jacket and black boots have "power girl" written all over them, but someone else was putting in the hard work.</p><h2 id=kristen-stewart-snow-white-snow-fight><strong>KRISTEN STEWART:&nbsp;SNOW WHITE? SNOW FIGHT</strong></h2><p>Kristen Stewart may be a lonely figure in Hollywood following the whole Robert Pattinson scandal, but there's no arguing that this actress has earned her A-list status. Sure, the paparazzi cashed in when Kristen was dating R-Pat and managed to find herself photographed cozying up to her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders. But Kristen was pulling epic stunts in that movie, and this was an actress who had a major fear of horses. Rupert Sanders spoke to MTV News about Kristen's fierce ways:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"She was riding horses, she was jumping from high precipices into freezing cold water, she was fighting dwarves – she's gung ho," Snow White and The Huntsmen director said regarding Kristen Stewart.</strong></p><p>Kristen may prove too much to handle in her relationships, but she handles her roles like a boss. That also applies to her role in the Twilight franchise. Kristen doesn't get her sparkling vampire boyfriend to do the dirty work. She takes care of it herself. Kristen did all of her own stunts for the romantic drama, and taking on Snow White forced her to overcome her fear of horses. Talking to EW about Rupert, Kristen said, "He definitely threw me off cliffs and made me trudge through frigid, icy waters. It looks cool, though. I can actually see the pain and discomfort on my face."</p><h2 id=kate-beckinsale-relied-on-her-double><strong>KATE BECKINSALE:&nbsp;RELIED ON HER DOUBLE</strong></h2><p>Not fooling anyone. Kate Beckinsale is a solid A-lister with an impeccable track record – except that teeny tiny detail – the body double. The Daily Mail&nbsp;photographed Kate on the set of Total Recall with her doppelgänger, and this isn't the only movie Kate has used someone else for the tough work. Alicia Vela-Bailey is barely distinguishable from Kate here, but this is a behind the scenes woman who has pulled stunts in everything from Underworld to Marvel's Most Wanted. The two seem to be enjoying the Toronto sunshine here, but it seems a little unfair. Kate enjoys the limelight and endless accolades, but the grind is someone else's work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Kate looks the spit of her body double here, on the set of Total Recall. Kate Beckinsale may be a great actress, but she's also great at using doubles. Alicia Vela-Bailey has also doubled in Wonder Woman, Batman v. Superman, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</strong></p><p>The good news is that Alicia has managed to build herself an acting career of her own. She played the villain in horror movie, Lights Out and a Lycan in Underworld: Blood Wars. Kate has told The Daily Telegraph that her Underworld role helped her "gain confidence and strength." Right, except when that "confidence" is a result of someone else's "strength..."</p><h2 id=mila-kunis-the-real-black-swan><strong>MILA KUNIS: THE REAL BLACK SWAN</strong></h2><p>There was more to "learning the lines" for Mila Kunis when she agreed to take on the role of a ballerina in Black Swan. By the end of her three-month training for the movie, an already slim Mila weighed just 95lbs, and she described the Black Swan diet as "terrifying." Losing weight for a role is something we've seen before. Christian Bale famously lost 62lbs on a diet of coffee and apples for The Machinist (where he also put himself through sleep deprivation). While Mila didn't fully starve herself, she was quoted as saying, "I don't recommend anybody ever doing it." Not only did Mila undergo ballet training for her role in Black Swan, she whittled her body down to 95lb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I trained four hours a day, seven days a week, for seven months. I had one day off on my birthday and half a day off for the Emmys and the Golden Globes. I lost 20lb. By the end, I was 95lb."</strong></p><p>Mila learned all the movements from scratch, and told The Daily Mail that: "it took me five months to lose the weight. The film industry isn’t as competitive as the world of ballet. I can’t even put into words how competitive the ballet industry is." Mila came out the winner, though.</p><h2 id=anne-hathaway-thought-the-body-double-was-her><strong>ANNE HATHAWAY: THOUGHT THE BODY DOUBLE WAS HER</strong></h2><p>It's instances like these that make us wonder if Anne Hathaway should stick to romantic comedies. Catwoman is a pretty intense role to take on, but take it on Anne did for The Dark Knight Rises. This one achieved a whole level of embarrassing in 2017, when Anne was giving an interview to Vulture about keeping in shape during pregnancy. Anne was "proud to keep her rear in great shape." Checking herself out on-screen for reference, Anne then admitted that the shot she was referring to was actually her body double. The Princess Diaries actress had to confess that her stunt double did such a good job, even she couldn't tell who was the real Anne.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"There's this shot in the movie, and when I saw it, I was like: I kept myself in great shape. The second time I watched the movie, I realized it was my stunt double," Anne said about her Catwoman "copy cat."</strong></p><p>Hathaway is known for her roles in comedic and dramatic roles, so it was pretty shocking when she took the action-packed part of Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises. Of course, she opted for a helping hand for her combat and motorcycle scenes. Fortunately, the other Catwoman, Halle Berry, does it all herself.</p><h2 id=cameron-diaz-refuses-to-use-doubles><strong>CAMERON DIAZ: REFUSES TO USE DOUBLES</strong></h2><p>Cameron Diaz is currently enjoying a bit of an "anti-Hollywood" lifestyle. The pregnant actress is mostly spotted in a pretty hippie wardrobe of floral hareem pants and totally #nomakeup looks, but Cameron deserves some serious respect. She's one of the few actresses in Hollywood who flat-out refuses to use stunt doubles, and the Knight and Day star is no slouch. Cameron suffered cuts and bruises while delivering flawless stunt driving, which, of course, she did herself. Cameron doesn't have the world's biggest action portfolio, but when she commits, she fully commits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Cameron Diaz refuses to use stunt doubles. Her two Charlie's Angels movies and Knight and Day saw a bruised Cameron do her own stunt driving. "I love training for fight sequences," Cameron said. "It's a week of getting bruises, cuts, and sprains, but it's also a lot of fun."</strong></p><p>According to The Mirror, Cameron was so good at her stunt work, her director actually suggested she do it full-time. Knight and Day director said, "I had two actors who are also incredibly gifted stunt people. Our stunt coordinators could tell you that Tom Cruise or Cameron could stop acting tomorrow and start a career as a stunt person." Of course, Tom Cruise does stunts on a whole other level – he literally IS&nbsp;Mission Impossible.</p><h2 id=cara-delevingne-maybe-she-should-stay-away-from-action-movies><strong>CARA DELEVINGNE: MAYBE SHE SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM ACTION MOVIES</strong></h2><p>Here are two things that seem to go hand-in-hand. Suicide Squad and Cara Delevingne. The British model and actress may be in Hollywood's coolest squad, but she's been racking up the scandal like there's no tomorrow. In 2014, her La Perla lingerie ad was slammed for having been Photoshopped – an already slender Cara appeared to have been slimmed down from her thighs to her waistline, while her curves seemed enhanced. Cara actually posted a before and after pic as a "kind of" apology. What's less known, though, is that Cara's Suicide Squad role had a body double.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>From having her figure Photoshopped to having body doubles in Suicide Squad, Cara Delevigne isn't showing model behavior. Here she is with her Suicide Squad doppelgänger, Tara Macken.</strong></p><p>While Cara has millions of Instagram followers, Tara barely has more than 10,000. Tara has nonetheless provided her stunt double services in more than 20 movies and TV series, including G.I. Joe, Glee, and Mission Impossible II star, Maggie Q. There's nothing wrong with a model taking on acting. Cameron Diaz and Gal Gadot are living proof – but at least they pull their own stunts. Presumably, Cara would be too busy living the high life to ever read an article like this.</p><h2 id=chloe-bennet-a-real-agent><strong>CHLOE BENNET: A REAL AGENT</strong></h2><p>This girl went from pop star to superhero for a reason. Chloe Bennet is enjoying some pretty sweet fame, thanks to good old hard work. When Chloe joined Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., she put herself through rigorous stunt training to make her character come off as authentic as possible. Behind the youthful face and charming smile, there's a dedicated machine of an actress who deserves all the recognition she's getting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chloe Bennet did two months of kickboxing, boxing, Krav Maga, and Jiu Jitsu&nbsp;to build up her Daisy character on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. "They said, Oh, a week before we start filming, you'll do some training, "Chloe said. "There was just no way, in my mind, that was going to be enough."</p><p>Chloe told Teen Vogue how she pushed her body to the limits to "make it look effortless." Even if it meant chasing the Ghost Rider on the hood of a moving car. "When I was a kid, I genuinely didn't think I'd get to be on TV without having blonde hair and blue eyes." Chloe has also said it would "be cool" to fight alongside the Avengers. Honestly? She could probably manage it.</p><h2 id=krysten-ritter-needs-private-investigating><strong>KRYSTEN RITTER: NEEDS PRIVATE INVESTIGATING</strong></h2><p>When you're being cast&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Marvel show, people expect you to be as tough as nails. Krysten Ritter got so famous following her superhero role in the Jessica Jones series, it's hard to remember that this actress was also on Breaking Bad. Jessica Jones is a no-nonsense private investigator with an edge. For Krysten though, that edge comes in the form of a body double – the same one she used in the Daredevil series. Dejay Roestenberg is the doppelgänger in question, although you can't say hair and wardrobe haven't done a good job, here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Krysten Ritter's Jessica Jones body double landed the part thanks to her ability to memorize complex martial arts and choreography. Amazingly, this action professional has five kids.&nbsp;Speaking to Games Radar, Krysten said that being Jessica Jones had been "completely life-changing."</strong></p><p>"People often come up to me and say they feel deeply, personally connected to Jessica." So... connected to the stunt double? It's time the ten tough ladies on here got some respect. The other ten? That's for you to judge. Hit share so your friends can see –&nbsp;if you can time it to land on their Facebook feed just as they're walking out of the MCU screening, they'll probably love you even more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpYGKupMDRnqqsnaNixKm7jJ2mZqyYmrazec6wpWarpKq7tb%2BMmqWdZWFleri0zmapnqSpYryvecGom7JllKTCo7jErGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
