It is clear that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is going to be very different than the first film. After Chadwick Boseman died of colon cancer at age 43 in August 2020, the filmmakers had to rethink how a sequel would work without his character, T’Challa.
In December 2020, Disney announced that a new actor would not be hired to fill the role, adding that the new movie would focus on other characters within the world of Wakanda, the fictional African country where T’Challa was king."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Black Panther, that was his movie. He was hired to play that role before anybody else was even thought of, before I was hired, before any of the actresses were hired.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lupita Nyong’o</strong></a>, who played Nakia in the first film and will reprise the role for the November 2022 film, agreed with the director. “It’s gonna be different, of course, without our king to go back into that world, but I know that all of us are dedicated to reimagining or carrying on his legacy in this new Black Panther,” the Oscar winner said during a March 2021 appearance on Good Morning America. “And Ryan Coogler has some really, really exciting ideas that I look forward to bringing to life with the rest of the family.”</p><p>After unveiling the first trailer in July 2022 at San Diego Comic-Con, it became clear that the movie characters will be grieving the death of T’Challa in the sequel. Okoye actress<a href=#><strong> Danai Gurira</strong> </a>said it was important to honor both the actor and character’s legacies.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The most important thing, of course, was honoring our brother, our leader, and our king,” Gurira told<a href=#> Entertainment Weekly</a> at the time. “That was definitely at the forefront of our minds and our spirits and our hearts. There was this amazing impact that the first Black Panther had, so the need, I think, was to really solidify that these characters and this world have an arc. It wasn’t a one-time momentous thing.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything we know about Black Panther: Wakanda Forever:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXuaKvymanmqaknbKzedaaopqmlJZ6p7vRnq2eql2aw6a%2B2K2foqaXYsSmecqnprBlo6R6p63RaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
