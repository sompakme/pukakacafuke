I think when I went in there I just wanted people to hear the truth. I met her in 2017 and we know each other now, but we didn't know each other then."</p><p>Her "bad weather, tornado" reference during the reunion still stands, and she was eager to clear her name on&nbsp;WWHL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘RHOSLC’: Jen Shah Hints That Only Lisa Barlow Reached Out After Vegas</a></span></p><p>Cohen continued to ask about Barlow's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> loyalty to Shah</a> and whether or not the other women will forgive her erratic behavior.</p><p>"I just see Jen in a totally different way than everyone else does, " she explained, "I feel like some of the stuff that happened in Vegas, I just feel like she was misunderstood.
