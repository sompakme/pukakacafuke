He’s not a well-trained dog [and] he’s kind of a little jerk.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmaGqsq2%2FjKampmWclsKzrYysmLKrXZm8qHnGq5ihmZ1ir6rAjKGcq2WSmrOwvsRmo56Zpp67qHnWoquhZZqWuqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
