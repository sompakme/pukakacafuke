Not as famous as his brother, Captain America, but he is starting to make his name in Hollywood. According to IMDB, Scott has had brief appearances on TV episodes like USA's White Collar, NBC's Law, and Order: Criminal Intent, and Fox's Fringe. He recently appeared in the comedy Almost Love and played Oliver in the Netflix series Grace and Frankie (2019).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-father-is-a-dentist><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>His Father Is A Dentist</span></h2><p>Chris Evans' teeth are impressive white, not the product of Hollywood unrealism. But it is thanks to his hands-on father.<a href=#> On Jimmy Fallon's show</a> in 2011, Evans revealed that he is bleeding to have a father who is a dentist. Fortunate, as he grew older, he appeared to be the village idiot with teeth attempting to escape his face. Evans continued by saying that he later had clear braces to assist him in fixing his smile.</p><h2 id=he-once-starred-in-one-of-marilyn-manson-rsquo-s-music-video><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Once Starred in One of Marilyn Manson’s Music Video</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Could you believe Evans starred in the Tainted Love music video by Marilyn Manson in 2001 alongside his Not Another Teen Movie co-star Jaime Pressly and Eric Christian Olsen?

Evans was chosen to play Johnny Storm, a.k.a. the Human Torch, in the 2005 movie Fantastic Four. But unfortunately, The Guardian reports that neither critics nor moviegoers liked this movie or its sequel movie, Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surf (2007). Although he is now widely known as a hero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he has played villain as well in the film <a href=#>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a> where he portrayed the character of Scott Lee who is the rival of Michael Cera’s character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-starred-in-a-short-educational-film><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Starred In A Short Educational Film</span></h2><p>Evans, who was 16 at the time, the Avengers actor, started his career with a 1997 short educational film called Biodiversity: Wild About Life, in addition to school performances and neighborhood theater productions.

He claimed that he initially declined Marvel because he did not want to become "can't-go-outside famous." His greatest worry, according to Lisa, was losing his incognito. He declared that he now has a career where he can do what he enjoys. He can do everyday things like go on a dog walk, and nobody annoys him. And, because he has few friends, he is free to travel wherever. He was worried that he might lose that freedom and kind of leisure. However, her mother eventually talked to and convinced him to take the role. Good thing he accepted the role as the American actor is now having fun hanging out with his Avengers cast mates. Evans and colleague actress Scarlett Johansson intend to get matching tattoos with the original Avengers cast members to commemorate the release of Avengers: Infinity Wars, according to Entertainment Weekly (2019).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# title="This 'Pulp Fiction' Easter Egg Appeared In 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'">This 'Pulp Fiction' Easter Egg Appeared In 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqivsRmq6GdXaG2tcDLnmSkpp%2Bsu26ywJyrrGWRl7y2wIyloKCgpK6yor6MrKuaql2YtbO10macr5meqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
