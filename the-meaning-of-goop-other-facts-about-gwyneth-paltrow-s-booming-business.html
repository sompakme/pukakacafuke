The company has grown leaps and bounds since 2008. Today, there are "click and mortar" storefronts and the celeb-loved and celeb-attended "In Goop Health" annual summit which costs upwards of $500 per ticket and is regularly sold out.</p><p>But what is Goop exactly? And what's behind the curious name?</p><p>When asked by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>, to explain what Goop is and what it means, the entrepreneur answered, "... I think, at our core, what we’re trying to do is aggregate great information and product that helps people take a short cut to something that will optimize their lives, whether it’s some marriage advice or a great taco <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">place in Santa Barbara</a> or a nontoxic cleanser that works really well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Useful Goop Products</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider.com</a>, it all began back around 1995 when Paltrow was working on the set of "Jefferson in Paris", a historical-drama film. There, Paltrow began a habit of sorts of asking cast members and crew alike for recommendations for local eateries.</p><p>The story goes that Paltrow heard from "branding wizard"&nbsp;Peter Arnell&nbsp;that successful internet companies choose a name with a double "OO" in the middle, Google for example. This nugget of advice went along perfectly with the actress' idea of choosing a name that didn't mean anything but could potentially mean anything. Open to interpretation with a dash of peculiar eccentricity, Paltrow's brainchild, Goop was born. In 2009, Arnell's company took in Goop as a client. In 2018, Paltrow admitted that the idea for the name was at least partly inspired by her initials when she told the Wall Street Journal that the play on her initials was "stupid and funny."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it's not all stupid sunshine and funny rainbows, at least from where the curious public sits. The company has, at times, had its share of controversy. When Goop has supported products such as "jade vaginal eggs" and encouraged readers to "police their thoughts" and "eliminate white foods" from diets, Goop drew side-eyes from much of the public and haters have come out of the woodwork to sometimes question and sometimes attack the celebrity-backed wellness brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Paltrow and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, whom Paltrow shares her two children, Apple and Moses with, decided to divorce in 2014, Paltrow provided a rather thoughtful yet somewhat confusing statement to her website when she wrote, ""We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner."</p><p>The phrase "conscious uncoupling" actually crashed the site and Goop followed up with a 2,000 word explanation for the odd term.</p><p>Prior to 2014, Goop.com had served as mostly a wellness advice site. Then, the company <a href=#>took a drastic change into the world of e-commerce</a> which has helped the idea that started off as a newsletter transform into the million dollar enterprise that is today.</p><p>In 2014, Goop began selling their own line of vitamins, clothing, and home goods. 2017 marked another huge change for the brand when they broke ground on their first ever brick and mortar store in Los Angeles' Brentwood Country Market. This was also the year that the "In Goop Health" annual summit began.&nbsp;The following year, Goop started a podcast which continues to rise in popularity.&nbsp;Last year, Netflix released a series entitled "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Goop Lab with Gwyneth Paltrow</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What seems crystal clear is that Goop is continuing to thrive. It doesn't seem that Goop minds the controversy which seems attracted to the company at the mere mention of unusual products or seemingly bizarre wellness services. In fact, their website states, "We don't mind being the tip of the spear - in short, we go in first so you don't have to."&nbsp;Goop's Instagram tagline seems to say it all: "Making every choice count. Testing the waters so you don’t have to. Asking all the questions. Read, listen, watch, shop."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow's Daughter Promotes Goop By Roasting The Brand</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LAtimes.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">express.co.uk</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goop.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS0uMXNnquhZaCWubW%2BzrBkoKefmXquscCnoKefXZuupMDSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
