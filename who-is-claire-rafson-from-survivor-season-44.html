With only a few weeks until the premiere of Season 44 of Survivor, here’s everything you need to know about Claire Rafson.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center">A post shared by Claire Rafson (@claire_rafson)</p><h2>A contestant on Survivor Season 44 Claire Rafson has been an Eniac Ventures partner since October 2021.</h2><p>Claire earned a bachelor’s degree in history and Native American studies from Dartmouth College. During her tenure at Dartmouth, she was a member of the “SHEBA Dance Ensemble (Director), Inter-Sorority Council (VP of DE&l), Academic Mentor, Sigma Delta Sorority (Executive), Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, and Dartmouth Outing Club,” according to her LinkedIn page.</p><p>She presently works as an investment at Eniac Ventures. Her employment title also required her to work and “invest in potential early-stage companies,” according to her LinkedIn page.&nbsp;Claire disclosed in an exclusive conversation with Parade prior to her debut on the competition series that being on Survivor was one of her lifetime goals.&nbsp;She went on to say that she’d been waiting since she was four years old, or about 21 years now, and that she’d always wanted to give it a shot, eventually finding the confidence to register this year.</p><p>Claire described her best time in the competition’s past as follows:</p><p>“Because there are so many instances, I believe this is a bit of a cop-out. The Cook Islands was probably my greatest moment of all time. I admired how dominant the Aitu Four were. And my best moments were whenever they sent Candice to Exile Island.”</p><p>Claire revealed one event that helped prepare her for the competition:</p><p>“I believe it is difficult, so I will compromise on this one. I believe that simply existing has been that life experience for me. (Laughs.) So, for comparison, I’m a 5’2″ gay African-Jewish lady who is boisterous as heck. So, for my entire existence, I’ve been the strange one out, and I’ve stood out like a swollen thumb everywhere I’ve gone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yco5qhopp6s63FrKanZZanvK550q6pr6GmpL9uv8SaqqimXWmBbn6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
