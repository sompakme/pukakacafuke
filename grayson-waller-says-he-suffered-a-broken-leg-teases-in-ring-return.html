He then moved to <a href=#>WWE SmackDown</a>, as the blue brand selected him in the 2023 WWE Draft. Since his debut on the May 12 episode, he has hosted a few editions of the Grayson Waller Effect, but he has not had a match.</p><p>On June 27, Waller <a href=#>shared a video on Twitter</a>, in which he revealed that he suffered a broken leg in his last match on NXT. Waller claimed that, even with one leg, he was more valuable than most of the wrestlers who have two. (H/t <a href=#>Fightful</a> for the transcription)</p><p>“In my last match on NXT against Carmelo Hayes, I broke my leg,” Waller said. “Clean break to the fibula. But because I’m a straight-up gangster, I kept going, and I was moments away from becoming NXT Champion. Fast forward two weeks, I hobble on crutches into the WWE Draft. SmackDown, with the steal of the entire draft, chooses Grayson Waller. Despite the fact that I couldn’t wrestle. I could barely even walk. The reality is, Grayson Waller on one leg has more value than 99% of wrestlers with two. So what did I do? Week after week on FOX, I entertain millions with the Grayson Waller Effect, the hottest talk show in all of pro wrestling, rubbing shoulders with the biggest stars in the game. AJ Styles, Charlotte Flair, Asuka, the next tag team champions, Pretty Deadly. This Friday on FOX, I have the biggest star in the entire industry, Logan Pau.”</p><p>Waller noted that he has been training ahead of his eventual return to the ring, as he wanted to ensure that he came back in the best shape of his life. He refused to provide a date for his inring return, but he stated that fans would get an answer soon.</p><p>“Let’s stop talking about the talk show for a bit because I keep seeing what everyone is saying online,” Waller said. “Am I just a talk show host now? If I was, I guarantee I’d be the greatest talk show host in the history of this company. But as good as I am on the Grayson Waller Effect, as good as I am on the microphone, I’m better in the ring. So the question is, when am I back? Well, I have good news, but I have bad news.</p><p>“The bad news is, I don’t owe a thing to you social media flops. What I’ve learned the last eight weeks, all the pain, all the suffering, all the rehab, doing everything I could possibly do to make sure when I come back, I’m in the best shape of my life, people online couldn’t care less. The fans couldn’t care less. They didn’t celebrate the fact that I was SmackDown every week. They bitched and they complained because I wasn’t wrestling. So I’m not gonna tell you. But the good news is, you will get an answer very, very soon. It’s just gonna be on my time because that is the Grayson Waller Effect.”</p><p>WrestleZone will provide more information as it becomes available.</p><p>Waller will host Logan Paul as his guest on The Grayson Waller Effect on the June 30 episode of WWE SmackDown. WrestleZone will have coverage of the show as it airs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJxampwZ2K0s63YrKanZaeWua2x0WaqmrGjYrWmedKunZ%2Bdopqxbq2Mm6moo5Wjeq2xxmarnpmjmsButc1mqaKml2K%2FpsDUq6U%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
