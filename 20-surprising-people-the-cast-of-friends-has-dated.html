Courteney Cox marrying David Arquette? Please. She had "Courteney Cox-Arquette" in the opening credits from season five onwards.&nbsp;Huge&nbsp;Friends fans will also have noticed the "Arquette" added to every other cast member's name as a joke for The One After Vegas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel: "Oh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?" Friends didn't just give us a guy with three divorces, some girl next door, and their buddies. It gave us ten years of the funniest TV ever. Whether they were attempting furniture transportation ("PIVOT!") or getting fake tans ("Was that place the sun?") these six were doing one thing above all else:&nbsp;dating. Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc didn't need Tinder or any of today's dating apps.&nbsp;Earning $1 million per episode, you might say dating these actors was "a catch."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joey Tribbiani may have dated every woman in Manhattan (sometimes more than once), but is the real-life actor similar? Was there ever a "real Ross and Rachel?" These six have dated everyone from major talkshow hosts to the cast of the MCU. The chick and the duck? Their names didn't come out of thin air. Between the models, actors, actresses, and guest stars, these six even managed to date each other. And when it didn't work out, they could pull the "we were on a break" excuse. Move over, Brad Pitt. Here are 20 surprising people the cast of Friends has dated.</p><h2 id=jen-wanted-david-schwimmer-to-be-her-baby-daddy><strong>JEN&nbsp;WANTED DAVID SCHWIMMER TO BE HER BABY DADDY</strong></h2><p>Rachel spent a good chunk of her ten years on Friends being pretty mad at Ross, but Ross definitely made things difficult as well. Ross and Rachel are basically the greatest sitcom couple we've ever had, but ten seasons of these two made everyone wonder: Was there something going on in real life?</p><p><strong>In 2009, Jen reportedly wanted David Schwimmer to "give her a baby." Jen had apparently picked David as her "top candidate."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, The National Enquirer reported that Jen "wanted a baby with David Schwimmer." Okay, we did not know that. In a way, it makes sense. Ross had loved Rachel since, like, forever. They dated&nbsp;– a lot. Rachel kept those eggshells "from the first time you made me breakfast in bed." They got married in Vegas. They even had a baby. By 2009, Jen was in that awkward "in-between" phase. Brad Pitt was behind her, but she hadn't yet met Justin Theroux. Jen was dating a string of guys, including Vince Vaughn and John Mayer, but she was (and still is) childless. Neither Jen nor David have ever confirmed these reports, but the media outlet did say that Jen had reportedly selected David as her "top candidate" for a baby daddy.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-dated-paul-rudd><strong>JENNIFER ANISTON DATED PAUL RUDD</strong></h2><p>Long before the MCU had Ant-Man, Paul Rudd was a very different guy. The superhero years were light years ahead of this actor, and Paul was facing a bit of a "no way out," being typecast in a string of romantic comedies. In 1998, Paul starred alongside Jen in The Object of My Affection. Big surprise, it's about a New York girl who falls in love with her best friend (although he's more into guys). Jen and Paul's 1998 relationship gave Ms. Aniston&nbsp; a whole two years before marrying Mr. Hollywood Hunk, Brad Pitt. Weirdly, Jen and Paul later co-starred in the 2012 movie, Wanderlust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Is it weird to kiss on-screen?" GQ asked them. "We've made out for decades," Paul replied. To be fair, Paul is quite the joker. When Elle asked him what his best feature is in 2015, he replied: "My wife."</strong></p><p>According to GQ, Jen and Paul met as hopeful young actors in Los Angeles, although Jen should get a little more credit, here. After four failed TV shows (and not much encouragement from her Days of Our Lives actor of a dad), Jen approached a Friends and Law & Order producer at a Sunset Strip gas station. Warren Littlefield told Jen to "keep going," before ultimately casting her as Rachel Green in Friends. The next one has "Hollywood" written all over it...</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-s-girlfriend-is-17-years-younger-than-him><strong>MATT LEBLANC'S GIRLFRIEND IS 17 YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIM</strong></h2><p>This one is&nbsp;fresh off the press. Matt may have had his long-standing relationships and marriages, but the 50-year-old isn't slowing down. Months after he and the&nbsp;33-year-old producer, Aurora Mulligan were first&nbsp;photographed&nbsp;together, The Sun's May 2018 report confirmed that they are officially dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aurora is a producer on the TV show, Top Gear, where Matt has famously broken driving records. With a 17-year age gap, the Irish Aurora and former Friends star seem to make for a happy couple, but fans are speculating whether Aurora is too young for Matt. "They were very tactile. Matt keeps referring to her as his honey," a source told The Sun. At 33 years old, Matt LeBlanc's current girlfriend is 17 years younger than him.</p><p>Matt has been pretty open about his relationship with Aurora, especially on Instagram. Fans have been treated to pics of these two outside Matt's dressing room. They're even captioned: "I'm gonna be on tonight and my honey came to support me. How nice. #manwithaplan @auroramulligan @latelateshow." Matt and Aurora have since been spotted at a Top Gear screening, where The Sun reported that they looked "closer than ever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rocker-who-dated-both-jen-and-courteney><strong>THE ROCKER WHO DATED BOTH JEN AND COURTENEY</strong></h2><p>You might not live inside an imaginary sitcom, but you know the rules. If you date someone, their best friend is a "no-go area." What, Joey getting together with Rachel after the "Ross history" didn't teach you that? In 1995, Jennifer Aniston was one year into her newfound stardom. Rachel was still doing a hopeless job being Central Perk's "worst waitress ever," but the real-life Jen had found a guy.</p><p><strong>It's the biggest "unspoken rule" ever. You don't date a girl, then date her best friend. Adam Duritz dated Jennifer Aniston, then dumped her for Courteney Cox. "No one can find me on Tinder," he said in 2018.</strong></p><p>Adam Duritz came with edgy dreadlocks and a rocker status as Counting Crows' frontman. What Jen probably didn't know is that Adam also came with an agenda. According to People, Adam dated Jen for "a few months" before ditching her in the biggest rule-breaker of all. Dumping Jen and hooking up with Courtney Cox. Decades later, Adam was complaining to The Huffington Post that "no one can find me on Tinder. You muddle through and then you crash a wall," he said. Adam and Courtney didn't last, and nor did Adam's other girlfriends: Emmy Rossum, Winona Ryder, Christina Applegate, and Lara Flynn Boyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-reason-jen-didn-t-invite-matthew-to-her-wedding><strong>THE REASON JEN DIDN'T INVITE MATTHEW TO HER WEDDING</strong></h2><p>Here's something interesting. Matthew Perry wasn't invited to Jennifer Aniston's second wedding (to Justin Theroux). According to The Daily Mail, Matthew was invited to Brad and Jen's $1 million zen-themed wedding in 2000, but something was driving a wedge between these two. Probably the fact that Jen and Matthew "briefly dated," according to People. It all got a bit awkward after the show, when In Touch Weekly reported that things got really dicey between the cast members when lines started getting crossed.</p><p>When Bravo asked David Schwimmer if the cast had been asked to sign any contracts stipulating that relationships should stay strictly professional, David revealed: "Well, that was broken." Lisa Kudrow added, "I was not asked to sign anything like that." Friends fans got enough flashback episodes to get an idea of how the cast would all look as couples. Remember the "fat suits" Joey and Monica wore in the "what if" episode? That relationship had three people in it: Joey, Monica, and the 1000 tons of food she had prepared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was one of Rachel and Chandler, though. Chandler seems attracted to Rachel (although she ignores him), but didn't Rachel have that fantasy dream about Chandler? Neither Jen nor Matthew have ever confirmed their relationship. Matthew told People that Jen's 2015 wedding to Justin Theroux was "a surprise." Ouch.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-dated-conan-o-brien><strong>LISA KUDROW DATED CONAN O'BRIEN</strong></h2><p>Lisa Kudrow should probably be winning awards for having one of the longest-lasting Hollywood marriages.&nbsp;There aren't many of them out there. E! is reporting that Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith are "set to divorce." Brad and Angelina held out for 12 years, but Brad eventually opened up to GQ&nbsp;– the "chaos" of living with Ange was "like a mental asylum." Unlike her alter-ego Phoebe, Lisa has been going steady with her French husband, Michel Stern since 1995 – bonus points for marrying outside the A-list there, Lisa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa did, however, reveal to More that she briefly dated the talk show host, Conan O'Brien. In an interview with NY Daily News, Lisa said that there was an instant attraction and that Conan "really encouraged" her career. "He was really smart, really funny, and he thought I was funny," Lisa said. Despite both being the same age and in showbiz, Lisa revealed in 2011 that they were "better as friends."</p><p>In a way, this one makes sense when you look at Phoebe. Forget being quirky and vegetarian. Phoebe actually dated some pretty famous faces on Friends. "Mr. Enthusiastic," Alec Baldwin was a bit too much for her. Hank Azaria was too busy failing at his science job in Minsk. Paul Rudd (who played Mike) actually married her. The next one is just hilarious...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-technically-dated-the-chick><strong>MATTHEW PERRY TECHNICALLY DATED "THE CHICK"</strong></h2><p>Remember "The Chick And The Duck?" Okay, so these two farm birds weren't earning $1 million per episode, but it wouldn't have been Friends without them. In season three of the show, Chandler was still getting his head around the pet chick and duck that Joey had adopted. Between quacking, the birds mostly sat around watching TV, although they were subject to "Nutter Butter contests" from time to time. Of course, there was the issue over what to name them.</p><p><strong>"That's Yasmine Bleeth," Chandler said to the pet chick while they watched Baywatch. "She's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. In very different ways." Matthew Perry actually dated the model Yasmine.</strong></p><p>Between 1996 and 1997, Matthew actually dated the model and Baywatch star, Yasmine Bleeth, according to IB Times. This just makes the whole "chick and the duck thing" so much more awesome. Plus, it explains why Chandler was so protective of his chick, Yasmine. When Ben Stiller guest-starred and yelled at the birds, Chandler took a firm stand. "Step away from the duck," he said. Chandler also got way more protective when the birds were bickering. "Now when you come back, I hope you remember that that chick is NOT A TOY!" Now you know why!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-dated-julia-roberts-on--and-off-screen><strong>MATTHEW DATED JULIA ROBERTS ON- AND OFF-SCREEN</strong></h2><p>For the most awkward guy on TV, Chandler Bing sure did rack up some good-looking ladies. It took Chandler a good five seasons to find "the most beautiful woman in most rooms," Monica Geller. While Chandler and Monica went on to get married and get those babies Monica so desperately wanted (thanks, "adoption mom," Anna Faris), this one takes us further back. Julia Roberts made her guest appearance on Friends in season two, as Chandler's childhood friend.</p><p>"Susie Underpants" (played by Julia Roberts) was out to get some serious revenge on Chandler. "My skirt! You lifted! Kids laughing! I was Susie Underpants 'til I was 18!" Julia yelled. Her plan was coy, though. Seducing Chandler into a restaurant bathroom was just a ploy to leave Chandler completely compromised. If you remember Chandler leaving the eatery with the only dignity he could – a bathroom door covering himself up&nbsp;– you'll know that "Susie Underpants" succeeded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"How do I get girls to go out with me?" Matthew asked himself in an interview with The Daily Mail. "Being on Friends always seemed to help."</strong></p><p>Here's what you didn't know, though. Julia and Matthew actually dated, according to The Daily Mail.&nbsp; Julia has also famously dated Daniel Day-Lewis, Ethan Hawke, Kiefer Sutherland, Richard Gere, and Liam Neeson. Plus, Chandler, on and off screen.</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-pulled-a-joey-with-a-soap-actress><strong>MATT LEBLANC "PULLED A JOEY" WITH A SOAP ACTRESS</strong></h2><p>"How you doin'?" You only need to watch one episode of Friends to know that Joey Tribbiani was the biggest player in New York City. If he wasn't&nbsp;trying to date Rachel's sister,&nbsp;he was having the world's shortest flings with anyone he met in the Central Perk coffee house. Matt LeBlanc himself has surprisingly few relationships to his name, but he does have a reputation. His marriage to Melissa McKnight in 2003 lasted just three years. His relationship with Andrea Anders (who starred in the short-lived spin-off, Joey) lasted nine whole years. Matt's own dad tells a different story, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking a swipe at his son's "womanizing ways," Matt's dad told News Australia that he "hates" what his son has become. This was back in 2016, when Matt and Andrea had split. Rumors were flying around that Matt was behaving exactly like his on-screen character, Joey. From a&nbsp;model to a volleyball player, The Daily Mail were reporting that Matt was spiralling out of control. Jenna Jameson even found her way onto that list.</p><p>When Matt was filming Episodes in London, a UK soap actress came out saying that Matt had told her it was "on-off." Holly Magrath said that she had been "dumped by text," with Matt saying, "I can't see you anymore. Too much drama." Maybe too many years playing Joey made him become a player.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=courteney-cox-and-jim-carrey-had-a-spark><strong>COURTENEY COX AND JIM CARREY HAD A&nbsp;SPARK</strong></h2><p>Funny people like to date other funny people. In 1994, Courteney was nowhere near as famous as she is now, but she was already getting cast alongside Jim Carrey. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective had a weird storyline that mostly revolved around dolphins, but it did give Courteney the chance to get to know funny man, Jim Carrey. The movie doesn't exactly sit there with Jim Carrey's "greats"&nbsp;– in fact, Jen Aniston once told a story about hanging out with Courteney and bringing Ace Ventura to watch. According to The Daily Mail, Courteney "refused."</p><p><strong>Hollywood stars can be super-secretive about their relationships – did you see how Scarlett Johansson dodged the paparazzi during her Ryan Reynolds marriage? Not surprisingly, both Courteney and Jim have kept hush-hush about whether or not they even dated.</strong></p><p>Presumably, if anyone had interviewed Jim about his rumored relationship with Court, he would have played dumb. Of course, there was a Friends crossover in 2003, when Jim starred alongside Jen Aniston in Bruce Almighty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When CBS interviewed Jim about his relationships, he said that "there were many." Jim has dated (or married) Bridget Jones' Diary's Renee Zellweger, Jenny McCarthy, and Mad Men's January Jones.</p><h2 id=jon-stewart-took-jen-to-an-awkward-dinner><strong>JON STEWART TOOK JEN TO AN "AWKWARD" DINNER</strong></h2><p>Can't blame a guy for trying, right? Jon Stewart is one of those faces you'll always recognize. His years on The Daily Show made him a household name. It all turned a bit awkward in 2010, though, when his guest was Jennifer Aniston. Jen was desperately trying to avoid any mention that these two had dated, but Jon brought it up. This girl isn't just sarcastic on-screen, though. Jen's reply was just as epic as Rachel's one-liners.</p><p><strong>"I asked you out," Jon said. "And I remember thinking she's so excited to be on a date with me." Jen fired back with, "If I remember correctly, wasn't it sort of a group of us are going out, do you want to join?"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reminiscing about their "awkward first date," Jon reminded Jen how he had taken her to an Italian restaurant. "You brought so many of your friends," Jon said, adding that he assumed Rachel wanted him "to know all of her posse." Jen gave Jon a major side-eye before replying, "It's sad." Jen has since sat on that couch opposite Jon to discuss both of her movies,&nbsp;Cake and Horrible Bosses. She didn't discuss their "horrible date" ever again, though.</p><h2 id=giovanni-ribisi-married-a-supermodel><strong>GIOVANNI RIBISI MARRIED A SUPERMODEL</strong></h2><p>Friends didn't just have "the big six" as its famous regulars. Alongside Janice, Gunther, and Ross and Rachel's parents, there was also Phoebe's brother, Frank Buffay Jr. Dim-witted but adorable, this character was played by none other than Giovanni Ribisi (although you'll find Giovanni on Scientology lists, alongside Tom Cruise). While Frank Jr. made an interesting relationship choice with a woman almost twice his age on Friends, the real-life Giovanni is far more "Hollywood." The Avatar and Saving Private Ryan actor was married to Mariah O'Brien way back in the day, but they divorced in 2001.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Actors and supermodels – where to start? Leonardo DiCaprio definitely leads the way with this one. At 43 years old, Leo is currently dating the 20 year-old model and actress, Camila Morrone. Leo has also dated supermodels like Gisele Bundchen, Nina Agdal, Bar Refaeli, and Erin Heatherton. Giovanni? He actually married one.</p><p>Agyness Deyn is a British model and actress. Alongside being the face of major brands like Calvin Klein and Adidas, Agyness is known for her choppy blonde hair, and movie roles in Clash of the Titans, Hard Sun, plus the 2018 Netflix movie, The Titan. Giovanni and Agyness tied the knot in 2012, but they got divorced in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-were-cox-and-perry-rumors><strong>THERE WERE COX AND PERRY RUMORS</strong></h2><p>Seriously. That whole In Touch Weekly coverage of the big six dating each other is all pretty juicy. What's interesting is that when they all got together in 2016 to discuss possibly doing a Friends reunion, one cast member was notably absent. Matthew Perry reportedly "couldn't make it due to other commitments," according to Closer. Conveniently, that was the one interview where the cast was asked if any funny business had happened during those ten long years.&nbsp;Monica and Chandler were arguably TV's most-hilarious couple. Nobody saw it coming– not even the writers.</p><p><strong>Chandler: "You opened all the presents without me?" Monica: "YOU KISSED ANOTHER WOMAN?" Wedding blips aside, these two were awesome. But was there more to it?</strong></p><p>In 2015, Hollywood Life reported that Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry were "dating in real life." A source told the outlet that "they've leaned on each other before – during [Courteney's] infertility struggles and [Matthew's] personal battles." The Star reported that "there isn't any pressure to put a label on it just yet, but they're excited to see where this might go." Fans were disappointed to see zero evidence of this ever come to light. Still, they'll always have the on-screen version to fall back on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jen-actually-dated-her-friends-co-star><strong>JEN ACTUALLY DATED HER FRIENDS CO-STAR</strong></h2><p>It's hard to forget Joshua, the divorced shopper Rachel was&nbsp;asked to "dress" back when she was working at Bloomingdale's. Romance didn't just bloom between these two on-set, though. Joshua was played by Tate Donovan. While the on-screen relationship didn't last – Joshua had a fear of birds (told you the chick and the duck were important) – the actors themselves did. In 1994, Jen and Tate "dated for a couple of years," according to Tate himself.</p><p>What's really awkward here, though, is the timing. Jen and Tate had already split up by the time Rachel and Joshua were filming their on-screen dating. Rachel had gone to a lot of work to land herself Joshua. Rachel had thrown a fake party, had dressed up as a cheerleader, hurt her lip,&nbsp;and&nbsp;had worn that super-revealing nightgown. All of this was filmed while the real-life couple had already called it quits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Working with Jennifer Aniston was awful," Tate said in an interview with HuffPostLive. "Jen and I were breaking up," he continued. Saying that the producers throwing "six episodes" at him was really painful, Tate concluded: "It was bad." Jen even thought that Tate filming more episodes was an April Fool's joke. Ouch.</p><h2 id=just-how-many-friends-stars-did-minnie-driver-date><strong>JUST HOW MANY FRIENDS STARS DID MINNIE DRIVER DATE?</strong></h2><p>One at a time, please. When The Sun reported that David Schwimmer and Minnie Driver were an item back in the 90s, everyone was happy. David hasn't dated all that many people. He certainly didn't find himself with three divorces before the age of 30, like his alter ego, Ross. Aside from David's relationship with the singer, Natalie Imbruglia and some low-key actresses, it's been a simple affair. In 2007, David started dating the British artist, Zoe Buckman, and they've been married since 2010. Here's the thing. In 2016, when Matt LeBlanc's dad was venting his son's personal life out to News Australia, a certain name popped up. Minnie Driver was reportedly one of the multiple women Matt had "conquered" on his post-marital bender.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When Chandler "crossed the line" with Kathy, Joey was super hurt. In real life though, Matt LeBlanc did something similar. David Schwimmer and Minnie Driver were "the line."</strong></p><p>Of all people, Matt should know how that feels. After all, it was Joey's girlfriend, Kathy who got together with Chandler – "You're so far past the line, you can't even see the line. The line is a DOT to you!" Minnie comes with her own portfolio. Matt Damon, Mick Jagger, John Cusack, Josh Brolin, and David Duchovny have all been linked to her. Watch out for David Duchovny further down...</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-dated-heather-graham><strong>MATTHEW PERRY DATED HEATHER GRAHAM</strong></h2><p>He sure does get the good-looking ones. E! News called Matthew Perry and Heather Graham, an "odd couple"– and you'll find out why. If you thought Heather Graham had fallen off the Hollywood map since Austin Powers in 1999, think again. After the final instalment of The Hangover franchise in 2013, Heather became a regular TV face on shows like Californication, Flaked, Law & Order True Crime, plus her current role as Kim in Bliss. These two got together&nbsp;in 2003, when Matthew was at the height of his fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's something kind of neat about celeb dating histories. Those news articles "announcing" casting are still out there. In 2014, The Daily Mail predicted some super-awkward filming when it announced that Heather and Matthew would be cast together in the sitcom, The Odd Couple. Not only would these exes be starring alongside each other, they would be playing exes.</p><p>While the report pointed out that Heather has guest-starred on two of Matthew's shows,&nbsp;Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip and Go On, Heather just never showed up on cast lists. Was she swiftly replaced by someone else? "On good terms" is how these two are reported as being, but why wasn't Heather cast?</p><h2 id=did-matthew-break-renee-zellweger-s-heart><strong>DID MATTHEW BREAK RENEE ZELLWEGER'S HEART?</strong></h2><p>No wonder Bridget Jones had to keep a diary. It's becoming increasingly obvious that Matthew Perry is Chandler's literal opposite. Renee Zellweger is just one more lady proving it. The Bridget Jones's Diary actress dated Matthew Perry between her many high-profile relationships, according to The Mirror. For a girl who played a heartbroken London girl who "couldn't find love," Renee has dated more guys than Scott Disick has in his contacts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The newspaper reported that Renee's "finally&nbsp;[found] love" with a guitarist "after years of heartbreak,"&nbsp;but the list forming that heartbreak was long. George Clooney, John Stamos, Jim Carrey, Kenny Chesney, and Matthew Perry were all on the list. Was Matthew one of the heartbreakers?</strong></p><p>That's the thing about sitcom characters – in particular, good ones. They become so indistinguishable from their on-screen characters, that it becomes hard to picture them as anyone else. The thought of Chandler serial dating just feels wrong. After all, when he tells Monica she's "the best he's ever had," he ends that sentence with, "Call the other girls and ask. And it won't take you long."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=janice-dated-david-duchovny><strong>"JANICE" DATED DAVID DUCHOVNY</strong></h2><p>"OH. MY. GOD." Janice never entered a Friends scene without those three words, so we would be disrespecting her if we didn't do the same. Maggie Wheeler will forever be remembered as Janice – the whiney, clingy, overly-dramatic "background character" that nobody could ever get rid of. Janice brought drama wherever she went, and she somehow managed to get with all of the guys on Friends. Not happy with being in their love lives, Janice was also in the same delivery room as Ross and Rachel, plus she drove Chandler and Monica to pick a different suburban house to the one they had chosen.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;TV's most annoying character ever, Janice, was played by Maggie Wheeler. A million miles from the snivelling and clingy Janice, Maggie has actually dated the X-Files actor, David Duchovny.</strong></p><p>Maggie actually appeared on Californication alongside David many years later. According to EW though, these two were an item way before Friends had even started. Unless Maggie is Janice's opposite, we're kind of worried what extremes David might have gone to just to get rid of her. "I'll write you every day," Janice told a panicked (and lying) Chandler when she followed him to the airport. "15 Yemen Road, Yemen."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-had-a-day-off-with-ferris-bueller><strong>JENNIFER ANISTON&nbsp;HAD A "DAY OFF" WITH FERRIS BUELLER</strong></h2><p>Thank you, 1990. Four years before Friends started airing, Jen was struggling in shows that weren't bringing much success. After a stint on Molloy (with The Big Bang Theory's Mayim Bialik), Jen was cast in the TV adaptation of the iconic movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Her co-star, Charlie Schlatter apparently thought that Jen was hot – although NY Daily News reported that the entire cast felt the same way. These two had young love, which Jen has reflected on herself.</p><p><strong>"A torrid romance" is what Jen and her Ferris Bueller co-star, Charlie Schlatter were said to have. Creepily, Jen played his sister in the TV series.</strong></p><p>"Jen was lovely, kept herself to herself on-set, smoldering a bit like her outraged character," an on-set assistant on Ferris Bueller told NY Daily News. GQ then exclusively reported that their fling was passionate. The magazine said that everybody seemed to be crushing on Jen.&nbsp;Fortunately, the next one has no family ties whatsoever...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-leblanc-dated-kate-hudson><strong>MATT LEBLANC DATED KATE HUDSON</strong></h2><p>Just last year, Matt turned 50. Of course, Joey Tribbiani will always be 30 ("We had a deal, God! WE HAD A DEAL!"). To mark Matt's 50 years on earth, IB Times took a look over the actor's life. They dug out some pretty neat facts. Like the fact that Matt's first acting gig was a Heinz Tomato Ketchup commercial in 1987. Ironically, the tag for that was: "The best things come to those who wait." Like Joey would ever "wait" for food&nbsp;– or women.</p><p>They also reported that in the late 90s, Matt dated a young Kate Hudson. The couple was spotted in bars, although it's not like the paparazzi had much in the way of sophisticated cameras back then. You could say that Kate was literally "almost famous" in the late 90s, since her&nbsp;hit movie, Almost Famous came out in 2000. As to why Kate and Matt didn't last, no one will ever know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If something about this made that nostalgia kick right back in gear, we are glad. Friends was one of the best shows TV has ever had, but you probably had no idea about some of the relationships on this list. If your Facebook friends list is basically one giant Friends fanbase, hit share for your own friends. They should probably see this...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGLAtr7Pq6CsoZ6cerGxzqmjnmWknbJur8Csq2anlmKzs7XEp5usZZiWwG6wwK2cnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
