Drew McIntyre came to the ring on the January 9 episode and shared his thoughts on his loss to Seth Rollins at WWE RAW: Day One. He noted that if he was holding himself back, he needed to step away from WWE for a while.

He stated that he came to the ring so McIntyre could talk to his face. McIntyre said that he and some of the guys had a bet as to how long Punk could last before he self-destructed. He told Punk that he was one of the few guys that had traveled with Punk, and he knew the real CM Punk.</p><p>McIntyre looked back on the days he was a young kid, and he had some personal issues, and he needed a leader, but Punk saw him as a threat. McIntyre emphasized that he had matured, and he was a leader now. Punk then said he had never called himself a leader. He noted that McIntyre watched him leave WWE, much like he saw Drew come back to the company.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-drew-mcintyre-declares-for-wwe-royal-rumble>Drew McIntyre Declares For WWE Royal Rumble</h2><p>Punk stated that he was not a demon, he was Satan himself when he was pushed. He said he was a nice guy until it was time not to be. He made it clear that he was back to finish what he started, and that would continue at WWE Royal Rumble. McIntyre responded by telling Punk he would compete in the Royal Rumble. He said he would eliminate Punk and go on to win.</p><p>Punk fired back that the only person who could stop him was himself.
