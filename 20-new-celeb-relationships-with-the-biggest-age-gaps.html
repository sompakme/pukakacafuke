There are still a lot of people who believe that age is just a number and even though they have grown up in a different generation&nbsp;than their partner, it's likely that the relationship will last. Just because it's strange to fans that this couple would end up together, that doesn't mean that the&nbsp;couple can't make it work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been instances when age gaps have become a huge issue for stars in the spotlight because they don't have a lot in common and there is a lot of pressure on them from the media and people who believe that they shouldn't be together.</p><p>There are many couples who have been in the spotlight over the past few decades who have shown that there is hope for these couples because they have been able to make their relationships work against&nbsp;all odds. After all, age is just a number and as long as the couple is happy with each other then they don't have to worry about anyone else's opinion about their personal life.</p><p>The following list looks at just 20 of the newest celebrity couples who have the biggest age gaps. These couples haven't been together for very long, but so far they are managing to defy the doubters and make their relationship work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-and-neri-oxman---12-years>Brad Pitt And Neri Oxman - 12 Years</h2><p>Brad Pitt's divorce from longtime wife Angelina Jolie was made quite a public affair a few years ago, but it appears that Brad has finally been able to move on with MIT professor Neri Oxman. The&nbsp;two&nbsp;were first linked together back in April when it was revealed that the couple had gotten to know each other after meeting through an MIT architecture project.</p><p>An insider told <a href=#>US Weekly</a> that "Brad is absolutely smitten by her" and that "their chemistry is off the charts." It was also rumored that the couple had been dating secretly for six months and that it took Brad a long time to move on after his breakup with fellow actress and A-list star Angelina but he had finally been able to move on with Oxman. According to US Weekly, Brad and Neri are taking their relationship day by day and speak multiple times a day on the phone, but Oxman isn't ready to give up her life at Cambridge for anyone, not even Brad Pitt. Even though Neri obviously challenges Pitt when it comes to her intellect, the professor is only 42 years old, which makes her 12 years younger than the worldwide acclaimed actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-and-camilla-morrone---23-years>Leonardo DiCaprio And Camilla Morrone - 23 Years</h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best-known actors in the world but his personal life has made interesting reading over the past few years. DiCaprio has recently been linked with aspiring model and actress Camilla Morrone, who is more than two decades younger than the Oscar-winning star. DiCaprio has been linked to the likes of Emma Bunton, Kristen Zang, Emma Mille, Gisele Bündchen and Bar Refaeli throughout the course of his career but in April 2018 it was finally revealed that the star had moved on to Morrone.</p><p><strong>The&nbsp;two were&nbsp;first linked together back in December when Leo was pictured leaving her house. Over the past few months, the couple has been pictured a number of times including Ellen DeGeneres' 60th birthday party in LA side-by-side and during Eminem's gig at Coachella.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morrone herself isn't a stranger to the spotlight since her mother Lucila Sola has been in a relationship with Al Pacino for the past nine years and her father Maximo Morrone is a former model and actor. <a href=#>The Daily Mail </a>reported yesterday that the couple was still getting cozy on date night a few days ago. It appears that the age gap between the two stars hasn't been an issue.</p><h2 id=dane-cook-and-kelsi-taylor---26-years>Dane Cook And Kelsi Taylor - 26 Years</h2><p>It's not uncommon for celebrities to date much younger women, but Dane Cook's latest relationship is with a woman who is almost three decades younger than the actor. The couple has been dating on the down low in recent months, but <a href=#>Romper</a> reported that the duo could have actually been quietly dating for more than a year.</p><p><strong>Cook and Taylor are both part of the entertainment industry, even though neither star has actually spoken publicly about how they met. Cook has become well-known as a stand-up comedian, while Taylor has sung backup vocals for the likes of Demi Lovato and Little Big Town through the course of her career.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple's first photos together were shared on Instagram back in April 2017 and it appears that much of their relationship has been shared on social media in recent months, with Cook sharing the following supportive message on social media: “My girl @itskelsitaylor is one of my favorite people on the planet. She’s a talented singer but more importantly, she’s a genuine person." There may be almost three decades between Cook and his 19-year-old girlfriend, but the couple are definitely defying their doubters right now.</p><h2 id=dakota-johnson-and-chris-martin---13-years>Dakota Johnson And Chris Martin - 13 Years</h2><p>Dakota Johnson has become a star over the past few years after taking on the role of Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades Of Grey series. It appears that the actress has been dating Coldplay singer Chris Martin over the past six months, even though the couple has been very private about their love life throughout their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The couple has been so private about their relationship, that this week E! News&nbsp;has revealed that there are actually breakup rumors since Dakota was spotted kissing an unknown male outside an upscale Los Angeles market.</strong></p><p>A source stated that this interaction was "nothing more" than an interaction between old friends, and "she's still with Chris Martin and very happy." Even though the&nbsp;two haven't been photographed together since March, it is reported that the couple is still happily in the honeymoon period of their relationship and are just living their lives away from the spotlight. Dakota has been thrust into the spotlight following her recent high profile role in the franchise, but since the movies came to an end earlier this year, the actress has now moved on to bigger projects, while her singer boyfriend continues to perform on a regular basis, meaning that the couple could be struggling to find time together around their busy schedules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-mclean-and-paris-dylan---48-years>Don McLean And Paris Dylan - 48 Years</h2><p>The biggest age gap on the list sees American Pie singer Don McLean linked to a self-confessed fan of the folk singer Paris Dylan. The 24-year-old model accompanied the 72-year-old on a press tour back in March, which made headlines because of their 48-year age difference.</p><p><strong>The singer-songwriter split from wife Patrisha Shnier back in 2016 after nearly 30 years of marriage and it has taken him a while to move on from this. After Paris accompanied the folk singer on his press tour of the UK and Ireland earlier this year, it started rumors that the&nbsp;two&nbsp;were much closer than friends.</strong></p><p>Paris has claimed throughout her career that she watched Don McLean videos up to three times a day when she was growing up and that she has always been a huge fan of the legendary singer. Paris isn't a stranger to the spotlight since she has appeared in magazines like Maxim throughout the course of her career. <a href=#>The Daily Mail </a>reported that the romance between the&nbsp;two had been going on for around a year before it was made public and despite the huge age difference the couple was working hard to make it work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=savannah-chrisley-and-nic-kerdiles---4-years>Savannah Chrisley And Nic Kerdiles - 4 Years</h2><p>Savannah Chrisley is the daughter of rich real estate mogul Todd Christley and has become a popular star all over the world following her appearances alongside her family on Chrisley Knows Best. The 20-year-old star revealed that she had a new boyfriend back in January after she wrote a touching tribute to her new beau Nic Kerdiles on her Instagram page.</p><p>Kerdiles is best known in ice hockey circles but is four years older than his new girlfriend. Despite the age difference, the most recent news coming from the family is that&nbsp;<a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;reported that Todd has already accepted that his daughter has a new boyfriend and approves of her choice. The couple has shared a number of touching images and messages on Instagram over the past few months, ever since Savannah's first tribute to her boyfriend on his 24th birthday. Chrisley Knows Best has now been running for six seasons and it has introduced the entire family to the spotlight, which is why Savannah is now considered to be a celebrity in her own right. Her new boyfriend Nic currently plays for the San Diego Gulls in the American Hockey League and Savannah has been living bi-coastal while the Hockey season is underway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alexa-chung-and-alexander-skarsgard---7-years>Alexa Chung And Alexander&nbsp;Skarsgard - 7 Years</h2><p>Alexander Skarsgard has become best-known for his role in True Blood over the past few years, but his on again, off again relationship with British writer, host, model, and fashion designer, Alexa Chung has recently taken a turn since the couple recently was rumored to be back together. Chung and Skarsgard revealed that their two-year relationship had come to an end back in June 2017, but have since been able to patch up their differences to the point where they have been spotted out together for the first time in a year.</p><p><strong>The couple arrived in the UK at St. Pancras station back in March with their arms linked and seemed to announced that their relationship was back on, despite not being seen together in almost a year.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Skarsgard is an incredible seven years older than his girlfriend Chung, but the couple was able to make their relationship work for more than two years before they revealed that they had decided to split in the summer. <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;reported that "the two seemed happy but a bit tired. They walked through the station holding hands." Despite the age differences this relationship could be back on and the couple continues to look like the perfect pairing.</p><h2 id=orlando-bloom-and-katy-perry---8-years>Orlando Bloom And Katy Perry - 8 Years</h2><p>Orlando Bloom became a well-known actor after starring in a number of high profile movies over the past few decades, while his new girlfriend Katy Perry has become a heavy hitter in the music industry. Bloom and Perry were first linked together in January 2016 when they were seen flirting at the&nbsp;Netflix Golden Globes after party before the couple were then spotted a number of times out in public and shared many Instagram images.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple made their relationship official in May 2016, before a split was rumored in November that year. By January 2017 the couple was back in again when Katy and Orlando traveled to&nbsp;Tokyo's Sanrio theme park. March 2017 brought more rumors that the couple had decided to split once again, but by January 2018 the couple&nbsp;was spotted on a romantic holiday in the Maldives. Despite the fact that Orlando Bloom is 41 and Katy Perry is 33, the couple has managed to make their relationship work in the spotlight and <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a> recently reported that Katy hinted that the couple was back together and on good terms. "I'm sorry I have been spoken for and speak for myself," she said, and added, "And I'm very happy!"</p><h2 id=heidi-klum-and-tom-kaulitz---16-years>Heidi Klum And Tom Kaulitz - 16 Years</h2><p>Model and entrepreneur Heidi Klum has become accustomed to a private life in the spotlight, but her most recent relationship has definitely turned a few heads since her 28-year-old partner is 16 years younger than her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Heidi and Tokio Hotel guitarist Tom Kaulitz were first photographed together at the end of March before they later enjoyed a romantic getaway together to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

Despite the age gap, it appears that Heidi and Tom are still in the honeymoon period of their relationship since the couple has been seen&nbsp;looking in love at every public appearance they have made over the past two months. A source told US Weekly: “Heidi and Tom met through Germany’s Next Top Model. There was some connection through the show, He’s German [too], so it’s been fun and easy for Heidi. Tom is a breath of fresh air for her.

Cabello is just 21 years old and her new boyfriend dating coach Matthew Hussey is nine years older at age 30.</p><p><strong>The couple first made news back in February when they were seen publicly displaying their affection on a trip to Mexico. The couple was then spotted on another romantic getaway a few weeks later as they strolled hand in hand through LAX airport.</strong></p><p>Camila was linked to Shawn Mendes before her relationship with Hussey was made official, but Mendes and Cabello were just good friends. The singer revealed back in March that the best way to her heart is grand gestures. She told <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>: "One hundred percent. It’s more casual. Fewer grand gestures. Less romance. But I’m not into that." Cabello and Matthew have been pictured together in recent months looking quite cozy while on vacation, the star has also mentioned in a number of recent interviews that she is very very happy since her relationship with Hussey began.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-harbour-and-alison-sudol---9-years>David Harbour And Alison Sudol - 9 Years</h2><p>David Harbour has been pushed back into the spotlight over the past few years because of his role as Hopper on Netflix show Stranger Things.

Alison has become a well-known star in her own right over the past few years after she first appeared as Queenie Goldstein in Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, a role that she will reprise in the second instalment of the franchise later this year. Despite their obvious age gap and the reputation that Harbour has acquired in recent years when it comes to his personal life, the couple have remained close and looking cozy whenever they've been pictured in public and have been seen supporting each other throughout their respective careers, since <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;recently reported that both stars are also activists who have shared a lot of their relationship online recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake-and-raye---11-years>Drake And Raye - 11 Years</h2><p>Rihanna unfollowed Drake on Instagram,&nbsp;which was seemingly the end of what had been a whirlwind relationship for the two high profile stars.

Despite the age gap being an astonishing 11 years, the couple has been able to work through it over the past few months with a source adding, "He's&nbsp;got form for dating the hottest and most up-and-coming stars in the world so Raye isn't reading too much into it, they're just having fun at the moment." Whether the couple is just having fun or not, they have been able to remain one of the hottest couples in the celeb world in recent months.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blac-chyna-and-almighty-jay---11-years>Blac Chyna And Almighty Jay - 11 Years</h2><p>Blac Chyna stepped into the spotlight back in 2016 when it was revealed that she was in a relationship with Rob Kardashian. Chyna then gave birth to the couple's first in November that year, before the couple announced that they had split on Instagram the following month.</p><p><strong>The couple has been on and off for the past year but it seems that Chyna has finally moved on to someone else after putting the whole Rob Kardashian saga behind her.

Even though there is a 12-year age gap between the two stars the Twitter world is a huge fan of the mismatched couple and looking at some of the images, Davis is the kind of gentleman who definitely doesn't mind holding his woman's purse. <a href=#>Business Insider</a>&nbsp;revealed earlier this year that the world had become pretty obsessed with the couple because of their strange nature. The couple has been spotted&nbsp;out in public a number of times ever since they went public at the end of 2017 and every time they have looked loved up.</p><h2 id=kevin-connolly-and-francesca-dutton---13-years>Kevin Connolly And Francesca Dutton - 13 Years</h2><p>Entourage actor Kevin Connolly was linked to British actress Francesca Dutton earlier this year when <a href=#>US Weekly</a> revealed that even though the couple had only recently made their relationship public, they had actually been dating since the summer of 2017.

The couple hasn't allowed the age gap to affect them but has tried to keep their relationship as private as possible in recent months, to the point where they even avoided liking each other's photos on social media or even having photos taken together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michelle-williams-and-andrew-youmans---13-years>Michelle Williams And&nbsp;Andrew Youmans - 13 Years</h2><p>Michelle Williams has found it hard to start dating again after the sudden passing of Heath Ledger, but she was able to find love again in the summer of 2017 when she met Andrew Youmans. Williams and Youmans were able to keep their relationship private for a number of months before it was made public back in January.</p><p>Andrew and Michelle met when the couple was in Rome last summer and Williams was filming All The Money In The World. Even though Youmans is best known as a former teacher since he taught a class at the Stanford Graduate School of Business from 2015 to 2016 it appears that he and Williams have hit it over over the past few months and there are now rumors that the couple are already engaged, since Williams was spotted at the Golden Globes back in January wearing a heart-shaped diamond ring on her left hand. A source told&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that "it's the real deal" and Michelle "wants a good guy and a stable family." Williams has had a rough few years personally and it's great to see that she has managed to move forward with Andrew despite the 13-year age gap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elon-musk-and-grimes---14-years>Elon Musk And Grimes - 14 Years</h2><p>Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk was linked to Amber Heard back in 2017, but it appears that he has moved on to another young girlfriend in the form of&nbsp;Canadian musician Grimes. The couple had been dating for a month before they were first spotted on the red carpet at the Met Gala back in May.</p><p>According to The New York Post, the couple first bonded online when they connected over an artificial intelligence joke earlier this year. Grimes is only 30 years old but has been releasing music ever since 2010. Recently <a href=#>Consequences Of Sound</a> reported that Grimes was about to change her name legally with the encouragement of her new boyfriend. The artist who was born Claire Boucher claimed that she was changing her legal name to "c" as a reference to the speed of light. When asked about her much older boyfriend's thoughts on this change, Grimes claimed, "Well he’s the one who pointed out that my working nickname (c) actually&nbsp;[rocks] and I don’t need to look further…." It appears that the 44-year-old has been a good influence in her life, even though the couple has only been together now for around two months.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billy-idol-and-china-chow---18-years>Billy Idol And China Chow - 18 Years</h2><p>Billy Idol is a legend and a rocker that is known around the world, but after a number of setbacks in the dating department, it appears that Idol could have met his match in actress and model China Chow. The couple is another celeb pairing that has only made their relationship public over the past few months after they were spotted at China's father's famous eatery Mr. Chow back in April.</p><p>A source told <a href=#>Page Six</a> that&nbsp;“China looks like she is completely smitten" and that the couple&nbsp;had even been seen “making out.” Despite the fact that Idol is 62 and his new girlfriend is just 44, which is an incredible 18 years younger than he is, the couple has been making their relationship work. China has been linked to Mark Wahlberg and Steve Coogan over the past few years, but first posted an image of the couple on Instagram last year, which has started rumors that the couple has been dating in secret for a number of months. Billy Idol has quite the dating resume of his own, having been linked to the likes of Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, and Melissa Gilbert throughout his career but he has never married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGK7psOMnJylnZJiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxv4ywoK2gXam1pnnBop6gnaOpeqKzxGaemqijZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
