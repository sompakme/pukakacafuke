As a writer and actress for the series, Kaling got her foot in the door and hit the ground running with other popular projects like&nbsp;The Mindy Project, Never Have I Ever,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Sex Lives of College Girls. No longer a side character, Kaling has main character energy and has shown the ins and outs of her successes on social media. However, as open as Kaling is about her life on set as a writer, actress, producer, and beyond, she likes to keep her private life just that,&nbsp; private. While incredibly close with ex-boyfriend and former castmate <a href=#>BJ Novak, Kaling's empire</a> is her own and has never shared who the father of her two kids is and she rarely talks about her dating life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because it's rare to have a celebrity who keeps their personal life private, Kaling told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, “I think people are often surprised that for someone who seems as open as I am on social media and who writes things that seem drawn from my life, I find that stuff really private." However, the stuff Kaling has been open about on social media is both relatable and heartfelt.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mindy Kaling Launches Limited-Time Collection With Andie Swimwear</a></span></p><h2 id=mindy-s-commitment-to-her-health>Mindy's Commitment To Her Health</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mindy Kaling's appearance has been a topic of conversation over the years. She has been open about her troubles with weight as a teenager in her book&nbsp;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?&nbsp;but learned to accept and love the way she looked after college. And while she has stated in her book that she has never been a fan of exercising and found diet fads "fun," according to an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, she has a newfound appreciation for exercise as an adult and mother of two. Now more than ever, <a href=#>the celebrity's health is a priority</a>.</p><p>When Kaling isn't working on set, she has dedicated herself to running or hiking at least 20 miles a week. Doing this, the actress said on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that she has lost more than 40 pounds. Even more impressive, Kaling wrote, "My doctor told me that this year I was the healthiest I’ve been in years." As a mother of two, Kaling explained her health is a priority so she could be present for her kids. With more energy and confidence, Kaling has never felt better in her skin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=privacy-above-everything>Privacy Above Everything</h2><p>Most celebrities love sharing the ups and downs of parenting on social media and include family photos of their children.&nbsp;Because of the millions of fans, being transparent is important as someone in the spotlight. However, Kaling is different. In December 2017, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Katherine Kaling, and never disclosed who Katherine's father was or shared her <a href=#>face in a social media post</a>. "I do feel entitled to have privacy about my daughter and my relationships," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>&nbsp;in 2019. Because of her high profile, Kaling shared it was a boundary she was happy to put in motion.</p><p>In 2020, Kaling gave birth to her son, Spencer. As a single mother, Mindy does a balancing act between being a working woman in Hollywood and a present mother to two different kiddos. She was open about how different her kids were to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Better Homes & Gardens</a>&nbsp;when she shared how picky her daughter was with eating, but her son would eat anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Maitreyi Ramakrishnan Story - Here's How Devi From 'Never Have I Ever' Is Growing Her Empire</a></span></p><p>Having two kids has made fans all the more curious about the paternity of Kaling's kids, but that's a detail she may never reveal.&nbsp;“My feeling is that until I speak to my daughter about that, I’m not going to talk to anyone else about it," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>.</p><h2 id=her-love-for-reading-amp-sharing-new-books>Her Love For Reading & Sharing New Books</h2><p>An actress, writer, and incredible mother -- is there anything Kaling can't do? On top of it all, Kaling is also a <a href=#>New York Times Best Selling author</a>&nbsp;and has written 10 books. The average fan may not know about Kaling's impressive list of publishings, but reading is a large part of Kaling's life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, Kaling shares books she's read and swears by found on Amazon. As part of Amazon Publishing, Mindy and Amazon created Mindy's Book Studio — a place where she reads and shares dynamic books with sundry voices and enchanting tales. These books are personally selected by Kaling and later published by Amazon. "I’m passionate about bringing unique stories to readers and viewers, and I can’t wait to help discover and support talented new voices through Mindy’s Book Studio," she shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Publishing</a>. Sharing her love of reading with audiences expands her popularity while also sharing love with unknown authors.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Biggest Book Advances Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style Mag</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Mag</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Most Commended Books</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrjOqKJmoZ6otqWxjKagp5ypYriiuMinnqxloaq2psCMpaCfnV2ks6d506GcZquVqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
