He has been linked to several women over the years and caused a stir when it was alleged he had cheated on his wife, <a href=#>Elin Nordegren</a>. Then, in 2017, he debuted a new romance with Erica Herman. Things were pretty perfect for the couple until it wasn't.</p><p>Now, not only are they broken up, but there has also been a surprising end to the relationship as Herman filed lawsuits against Woods. The outcome may not have been what she initially wanted, as she later dropped them. But what led the former couple to reach this point? And how has it affected their lives going forward?</p><h2 id=what-is-erica-herman-39-s-net-worth-and-why-did-she-sue-tiger-woods>What Is Erica Herman's Net Worth And Why Did She Sue Tiger Woods?</h2><p>Erica Herman is best known as Tiger Woods's girlfriend but was also a former restaurant manager. She managed the golfer's Palm Beach County restaurant. While it is unclear how exactly her net worth has been determined and how much she benefited financially from her relationship with Woods, she is believed to be a millionaire. Her net worth is estimated to be around $3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tiger Woods has had an incredible golfing career, and according to Celebrity Net Worth, his net worth is $800,000. But some will find that figure to be conservative, and there are other estimates that his <a href=#>net worth is as much as $1 billion</a>. Either way, you look at it, Woods is loaded, and a lawsuit against him is unlikely to make a dent in his savings, even if it was for $30 million -- which is what Herman wanted from her ex-boyfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/erica-herman-completely-changed-her-life-after-suing-ex-boyfriend-tiger-woods-for-30-million.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to People, after Woods and Herman split, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she filed several lawsuits against him</a>. Or, more specifically, against his trust. One was an attempt to void the non-disclosure agreement she had previously signed. "Because of the aggressive use of the Woods NDA against her by the Defendant and the trust under his control, the Plaintiff is unsure whether she may disclose, among other things, facts giving rise to various legal claims she believes she has," documents stated, according to Us Weekly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elin Nordegren Has A Clear Stance On Tiger Woods' Relationship With Erica Herman</a></span></p><p>While the details of the lawsuit are complicated, in May 2023, it was reported that Florida Judge Elizabeth A. Metzger had denied Herman's request to go public. This means that details of the lawsuit against Woods and allegations made by Herman would be kept private.</p><p>At the time, the judge stated: "Herman has had the opportunity to provide factual specificity for any claim relating to sexual assault or sexual harassment; however, she has not done so. Additionally, at no time has Herman's counsel requested an opportunity to file …"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/elin-nordegren-has-a-clear-stance-on-tiger-woods-relationship-with-erica-herman.jpg><p>Herman lived with Woods but claimed he ended their relationship and kicked her out of the home. Herman alleges that an "oral agreement" was made that would allow her to continue living in the home despite a breakup. And that she was able to do so for five years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She sued him for $30 million</a> because she alleged he broke his word, and it was, therefore, an unlawful eviction under the Florida Residential Landlord Tenant Act.</p><p>Woods's trust refuted her claims. "In reality, Ms. Herman was invited to live in the Residence while she was in a relationship with her former boyfriend," the response to her lawsuit read via Us Weekly. "After Mr. Woods recently terminated the relationship, Ms. Herman was advised that she was no longer welcome in the Residence."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then in July 2023, it was announced that Herman would drop her lawsuit against Woods. "The Plaintiff, Erica Herman, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby dismisses without prejudice her Complaint, filed on October 26, 2022, pending resolution of the appeal in Herman v. Woods and determination of whether her claims are subject to arbitration," The New York Post reports.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>It Cost Tiger Woods And Elin Nordegren's Wedding Guests Thousands Of Dollars Just To Book Their Hotel Stay</a></span></p><p>Lawsuits are costly, and although it remains unclear exactly how much Herman paid in legal fees while filing her suit, she will likely be out of pocket after dropping her claims. Given that the lawsuit did not continue for years, it most probably won't have a lasting effect on her finances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-erica-herman-and-tiger-woods-39-s-relationship-like>What Was Erica Herman And Tiger Woods's Relationship Like?</h2><p>There was a time when fans of Tiger Woods may have thought the golfer had found love again, forever this time. And that was with Erica Herman. The former couple started dating in 2017, making their first public appearance as a couple at the President's Cup in September of that year.</p><p>Their relationship was serious. Still, there did not appear to be talk of marriage – at least, not according to a friend of Woods' who gave an interview about the relationship to People in 2018.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rachel Uchitel Thought Her Relationship With Tiger Woods Would Never Be Uncovered After This Particular Moment With Elin Nordegren</a></span></p><p>"No one has signed any paperwork," they said. "It's not like they're pledging their lives to each other. But she's really nice, and Tiger likes her. Tiger doesn't like to be alone. But he doesn't like to settle. Not anymore. So when he's with someone, he really needs to be into her." Woods was not the only one who liked Herman, as it was reported that his children, a daughter Sam and son Charlie, who he shares with his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, also got along with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/erica-herman-tiger-woods.jpg><p>"The kids like her," a source told People. The golfer's ex-wife had also given her approval. "Elin has a friendly relationship with Erica," the source claimed. "Tiger has come a long way and Elin acknowledges that. She is happy that he is dating Erica."</p><p>So, what went wrong in this relationship that was once seemingly so strong? "Erica thought Tiger was never at home, and Tiger thought Erica was spending too much and living too lavish of a lifestyle," the insider told Us Weekly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicq6GTlnqpsdGmmKerXaOytXnWqKmtoF2Xsqa6jJqdrZ2iYrGmr8isoKimXam8brDRqKdma2Biuqq4y6Kmp2WUpLmtrdFmo5qvo6q2tXnAoJiipqOperW1xp6pZq%2BfpLG0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
