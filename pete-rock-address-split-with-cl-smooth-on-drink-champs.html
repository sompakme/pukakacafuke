I’ve never heard a voice like this. And we shared great times together, don’t get it all fu**ed up now. We’ve had our good times, and then, you know, just like life, people have ups and downs. Sometimes, when we’re in the negative zone, we tend to go like this. What we would wish for each other is growth, but when one is growing and one isn’t, then it’s just still uneven. Even now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-174747959.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The duo first split in 1995 following the release of two albums, 1992’s&nbsp;Mecca and the Soul Brother&nbsp;and 1994’s&nbsp;The Main Ingredient. They went on to work together on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.vibe.com/news/entertainment/pete-rock-hip-hop-lost-integrity-chasing-money-1234838007/>Pete Rock’s solo projects</a> between 1998 and 2004. According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>HipHopDX</a>, the final rift came in 2018.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It should never be like this. Ever. We should still be together but some things, you know, that I can’t tell the whole public. But certain things happen in a partnership that just can’t be… and people won’t understand. I don’t want to be the only one speaking on someone who’s not here, but I wish him the best in life,” continued the 53-year-old continued.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Pete Rock’s commentary, however, did not end on Drink Champs. The “T.R.O.Y.” performer continued to discuss the breakup on social media, sharing a clip from the podcast on Monday (June 1).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This goes for anybody once in a group with a partner or partners. When things go left, take the high road. You have people who <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.vibe.com/music/music-news/pete-rock-joint-album-common-restore-feeling-1234790368/>rejoice separation!</a> When I make my business my business people start making up their own story cuz it’s nobody’s business but mine plain & simple like it or don’t,” he wrote in a lengthy Instagram caption.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You have people who tell their stories no problem and be on dem podcast talkin bout personal pronlems, thats not me mayne! F**k drama. That sh*t happened thats my business. Let people say and think what they want. Ignorance is bliss and real ones know this but dont believe groups stay 4ever. That only happens when 2 men really respect one another and their boundaries and has had similiar experiences happen to them and it gives each individual great understanding. Thats the important part! But i wish no ill will on CL Smooth but i kept telling yall for years i have moved on with all due respect . i can accept it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Check out a screenshot of the Instagram caption below and watch the Drink Champs episode above.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1703.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6WytbGMq6aco12WsaW%2BxKyqZqugoba1ecKlZKyln6TBqXnDq6Cno12YtaK5z6xkampjaYV5f5Jwb2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
