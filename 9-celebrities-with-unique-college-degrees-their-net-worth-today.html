Some became rich and famous at a young age and others a little later in life, but their <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is what fans look for to determine their success</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, not all celebrities banked on becoming rich and famous. They <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">continued their studies, attended college, and earned degrees</a>. Whether these degrees were meant to be a ‘Plan B’ in case Hollywood didn’t welcome them or if they just valued the benefit of education is a big question.</p><p>Take, for example, the many times we’ve heard of The Big Bang Theory <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayim Bialik</a>’s Neuroscience degree. Fans love to hear when their favorite celeb is full of talent and comedic timing while also being educated.</p><p>Check out a few more celebrities, their unique degree, and their net worth today. Some may surprise you.</p><h2 id=chris-martin-greek-and-latin>Chris Martin – Greek and Latin</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coldplay</a> frontman didn’t see stardom until after completing a degree at the University College London. He majored in Greek and Latin (perhaps a sign of looking for direction) and, upon graduating, became one of the top-selling bands of all time. In fact, it was at the University Martin met Will Champion, Jonny Buckland, and Guy Berryman, the three bandmates that created the band we know and love today. With a net worth of $130 million, it’s doubtful the rocker will need that Greek and Latin degree anytime soon.</p><h2 id=will-ferrell-sports-information>Will Ferrell – Sports Information</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The comedy master with a net worth of $160 million graduated in 1990 with a degree in Sports Information from the University of Southern California. The irony in this is that the degree no longer exists – a fact <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferrell </a>has time and time again made into a classic joke. Of course, Sports Information is now known as Sports Management and gives Ferrell a great backup should he ever stop making people laugh.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Disgraced Celebrity Psychiatrist To Be Subject Of Will Ferrel Apple Series</a></span></p><h2 id=rebel-wilson-law>Rebel Wilson – Law</h2><p>Another comedian with another impressive degree. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebel Wilson</a> earned her law degree from the University of South Wales in Australia, proving that she can play the blonde airhead on the big screen yet take control in a courtroom. Her acting career has earned the Pitch Perfect&nbsp;star a cool net worth of $22 million according to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, but if that doesn’t work out, Wilson will be just fine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-biology>Lisa Kudrow – Biology</h2><p>Another beautiful blonde that plays a hilarious airhead character on the screen has shown there’s more to her than just comedic timing. The <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a>&nbsp;star earned a degree in biology from Vassar in 1985, years before making it big on perhaps the most popular sitcom in history. Still, Kudrow has a net worth of $90 million, and her options are endless.</p><h2 id=ashton-kutcher-biochemical-engineering>Ashton Kutcher – Biochemical Engineering</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He often plays a goofy character, easy to laugh at with a handsome face, but <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kutcher </a>can be quite serious when it comes to education. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Life</a>, he earned a Biochemical Engineering Degree at the University of Iowa in hopes of finding a cure for his brother’s heart disease. Of course, with a net worth of $200 million, there may be more than one way to encourage health research.</p><h2 id=gabrielle-union-sociology>Gabrielle Union – Sociology</h2><p>The actress graduated from UCLA with a degree in sociology. The Being Mary Jane&nbsp;star <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been vocal</a> about student loans and part-time jobs. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, she paid her way like millions of other Americans. Union has a net worth of $40 million and is one-half of a powerhouse couple, married to NBA star Dwayne Wade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rooney-mara-psychology>Rooney Mara – Psychology</h2><p>Mara earned a degree in psychology, international social policy, and nonprofits from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University in 2010. Due to her extensive travel, Mara has said <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the trip to Kenya</a> for an acting project brought real-life examples back to her coursework in the states. The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo&nbsp;star boasts a net worth of $16 million and proves she has plenty of avenues to take should the acting offers slow.</p><h2 id=meryl-streep-mfa>Meryl Streep – MFA</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yep, even one of the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest actresses of her generation</a> went to Vassar College and then went on to graduate from Yale School of Drama with her Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree. She has a net worth of $160 million, and according to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the University of the People</a>, Streep wasn’t even interested in acting until she stepped onto the stage as Vassar. Today, she’s been nominated for a record-breaking 21 Academy Awards and has taken home three.</p><h2 id=david-spade-business>David Spade – Business</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a regular on <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturday Night Live</a>, it may come as a surprise that Spade didn’t forgo his education to get there. He earned a Business degree from Arizona State University in 1986. Though he could always go with his ‘plan B’, Spade had comedy in mind even in college as he performed in the sketch comedy show on campus and spent weekends at comedy clubs in Arizona. Today, he has a net worth of $70 million – perhaps more than he’d be making as a businessman anyway.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">25 Interesting Ways Mayim Bialik Handles Motherhood</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Best Life</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">University of the People</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSGbq%2FEpZybqpmptqa%2FjLCgraBdqruqvdSeZJynnKGyqLGMnZygqpWawG7Ax56gq2WemsFuw86rq6FlpKSxosWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
