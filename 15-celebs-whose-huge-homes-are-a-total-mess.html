Celebrities, for the most part, have it all. They have the fame, they have the power, and they have the money — lots and lots of money. When we see them on the red carpet or on TV, they are all glammed up. With all the money these celebrities have, it should be fairly easy to hire maids to make sure that their mansions are kept in tip-top condition. It’s mind-blowing&nbsp;that there are quite a few celebrities who live like complete pigs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you look at the living conditions of some of these celebrities, it may confuse you since some of their mansion are just downright filthy. It’s understandable that certain people have busy lives that can interfere with some of the most basic duties at times. However, this is ridiculous. From Britney Spears sleeping in crumbs to Kirstie Alley’s place looking like a zoo, the truth about how they live behind closed doors is shocking. It’s one thing to be a little messy from time to time, but it’s another thing to voluntarily be subjected to unsanitary, crummy, and nasty conditions. These 15 celebs who have messy mansions may or may not surprise you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears-bedsheets-are-covered-in-crumbs>Britney Spears' Bedsheets Are Covered In Crumbs</h2><p>Either she’s the princess of pop or the princess of slop. Her mansion looked like a catastrophe. <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>’ staff revealed that she had a habit of scarfing down food in her bed and she had no problem with sleeping in her bedsheets that were covered in crumbs. Can we say yuck? Years ago, Spears suffered a nervous breakdown that sparked nationwide headlines. Not only did the upkeep of her house take a plunge, but so did her personal hygiene. During her time of mental anguish, she was seen prancing around “with smeared makeup.” She was also seen walking into public restrooms with no shoes on. Fortunately, her family intervened, and she got the help she needed with a combination of medication, rehab, and family support. So far, Spears has been keeping up with her public appearance and has landed gigs such as The X Factor. In 2016, Spears returned to the MTV Video Music Awards stage along with G-Eazy to perform the hit single “Me, Myself, & I.” As far as cleaning up her act at home, that’s a different story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonc-is-a-self-proclaimed-slob>Beyoncé Is A Self-Proclaimed Slob</h2><p>With <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>'s flawless makeup to her&nbsp;perfect hair, her swag is out of this world. It’s a surprise that Queen Bey may not be as clean as you think. The image she portrays to the public is the opposite when she really is in the comfort of her mansion. She’s a “self-proclaimed slob” who revealed that she’s not the best when it comes to keeping her house tidy. While her marriage to <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> seems like the relationship for most to envy, her unwillingness to clean up is one of his “pet peeves.” Despite the typical stereotype that women are generally cleaner than men, that may not be so in this case. Jay-Z always keeps his space immaculate and organized, Bey keeps her space looking like a hurricane just went through it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=george-clooney-loves-partying-more-than-cleaning>George Clooney Loves&nbsp;Partying More Than Cleaning</h2><p>In spite of <a href=#>George Clooney</a> being one of the most sought-after bachelors, he is downright messy. Regardless of his role as a dedicated husband and father, he isn’t that dedicated to the upkeep of his house or his appearance. At one point, Clooney was considered to be a “giant, single slob.” As revealed by his maids, he could care less what his house looked like and it was the representative of a bachelor pad. He also loved his partying. Allegedly, he marked “all of the decanters in the home so that he would always know if they had been tampered with.” According to Daily Mail, his most recent mansion is situated on a “five-and-a-half-acre island.” The goal was to develop a dream family home. At the beginning of the project, Clooney stated to the builders, “What Amal wants, Amal gets.” The cost didn’t matter as long as he and his family got the home of their dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kirstie-alley-is-a-zookeeper>Kirstie Alley Is A Zookeeper</h2><p>If you’re thinking about having dinner at <a href=#>Kirstie Alley</a>’s house, think again. Her house is engulfed in pet hair. Maybe you could give it a shot if you don’t mind pet hair on the side of your dish. Alley is so devoted to her pets that she spent approximately $40,000 on her combination of lemurs and puppies. It’s too bad that she doesn’t spend that type of money on getting her house spruced up. Some of her friends said that the smell in her house was so potent that they found it strenuous to remain inside. Even more so, it was likely that they would be covered in pet hair by the time they left the house. Alley became best known for her role on Cheers, an award-winning series that aired on NBC. She also landed roles on It Takes Two, Deconstructing Harry, and Drop-Dead Gorgeous.</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-s-hair-is-everywhere>Jessica Simpson's Hair Is Everywhere</h2><p>This pop star and actress also has a hair problem in her house. The hair isn’t coming from any pets; it’s coming from her. <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> is notorious for taking her hair extensions and throwing them everywhere. Let’s not get started on the closet. Her closet was tormenting to her housekeeping staff because they could hardly see the floor when they walked in. Her clothes and hair extensions covered most of the room. In one instance, one of her staff members freaked out when she thought a pair of Simpson’s false eyelashes was a spider on the floor. Her messiness was apparently a huge turn-off for her ex-husband <a href=#>Nick Lachey</a>. Her housekeeping staff wasn’t too happy about it either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-s-room-is-filthy>Miley Cyrus's Room Is Filthy</h2><p><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> went from being Hannah Montana to a wild and public image. Along with Kirsty Alley, Cyrus is a pet-lover and her floors are disgusting. However, she has failed to properly train the many puppies she has running around her house. It has been said that she let her puppies leave&nbsp;their droppings all over and also has a pet pig that does the same thing. Instead of cleaning it up like a responsible pet owner, Cyrus yells at her staff and demands that they clean it up. In a selfie posted on Instagram, ashtrays, random pieces of paper, and shoes could be seen all over the floor in her room. According to OK Magazine, she may have transformed to clean up her act. “She’s quit all [illegal substances], bought an entire new closet, and has a total new attitude.” A source close to Cyrus claimed that her dramatic metamorphosis was largely because of <a href=#>Liam Hemsworth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-has-clothes-all-over-the-place>Kim Kardashian Has Clothes All Over The Place</h2><p><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, who is known for wearing some of the latest fashion trends, posted a selfie on Instagram that revealed a messy room. Apparently, Kim K was trying to figure out what to wear as she ripped through her wardrobe. Her daughter, North, was also in the photo and was seen wrapping “a pair of tracksuit bottoms around her.” The post read, “Yesterday… trying to pick out an outfit struggle.” Shoes, hangers and other items were all over the place while the coats were “stacked up on a nearby couch.” Kardashian is known for starring on Keeping Up with the Kardashians and other reality show spinoffs, such as Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami. Along with her family, Kardashian seems to always have nationwide media attention. In 2015, Kardashian was on the list of 100 most influential people by Time Magazine and has an estimated worth of $45 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-s-public-antics-are-the-same-at-home>Lindsay Lohan's Public Antics Are The Same At Home</h2><p>Is this surprising? With her&nbsp;struggles&nbsp;with&nbsp;addictions and partying, it’s no surprise that&nbsp;<a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a>'s house is not as clean as it should be. On Instagram, she posted a selfie with piles of clothes in the background that looked like they were “about to fall off the end of her bed.” There was also a fridge, fan, and a small microwave stuffed in the back-room corner. Throughout the years, Lohan has experienced numerous legal troubles involving&nbsp;illegal substances&nbsp;dating back to 2007. According to CNN.com, “she was twice convicted of [DUI], once for [use of illegal substances], made three trips to rehab and served an 84-minute jail stay.” Now, Lohan may be ready for a comeback in her career. According to USMagazine.com, a source said, “Lindsay is a changed woman. I worked with her in 2011 and again in 2017 and the difference is night and day.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-like-to-hoard>Angelina Jolie And Brad Pitt Like To Hoard</h2><p>At one point, this pair seemed to be the picture-perfect couple. However,&nbsp;<a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> and <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>'s&nbsp;glamorous looks do not match how they maintained their home. You would think that by having all of those staff members, that their home would have been kept in a better condition. Apparently, Pitt is allegedly a hoarder, “especially when it comes to his beloved architecture magazines.” It came as a shock to most people when the news spread about their split. In the summer of 2016, Jolie requested a divorce due to irreconcilable differences. She filed for full custody of their children. According to Popsugar.com, Pitt released a statement that read, “I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the well-being of our kids. Eventually, it was revealed that the couple had many fallouts over the years. An insider said, “The fighting got worse and they disagreed a lot about parenting. They would also fight over schedules and politics.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox-doesn-t-flush-after-herself>Megan Fox Doesn't Flush&nbsp;After Herself</h2><p>The actress became known for her breakout role on the hit film Transformers.&nbsp;<a href=#>Megan Fox</a> has been featured in popular magazines including FHM, Maxim, and Rolling Stone. With her gorgeous looks, she is considered to be a modern bombshell. Fox is also considered to be pretty lazy when it comes to her housekeeping routines and her bathroom habits. Apparently, “She is notorious for doing her personal business and just letting it sit around until someone with some manners comes and flushes the toilet for her.” It’s one thing to have maids to keep the house spotless, but it’s disturbing that she refuses (or forgets) to simply flush behind herself. She admitted to FHM Magazine that she’s horrible to live with. She said, “I don’t clean. My clothes end up everywhere I take them off. I forget to flush the toilet. Friends will tell me, ‘Megan, you totally pinched a loaf in my toilet and didn’t flush.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-aguilera-needs-a-genie-and-a-mop>Christina Aguilera Needs A Genie And A Mop</h2><p>This pop star is known for her hit single “Genie in a Bottle.” It’s too bad&nbsp;<a href=#>Christina Aguilera</a> didn’t have a genie to clean her house. After putting her mansion on the market, it took two years for it to sell. Even when she was in the process of trying to get a buyer, she still managed to have sloppy racks of clothes in the salon and “old-school arcade games in forgotten crannies.” Following the sale of her mansion, she purchased a new mansion for $10 million in Beverly Hills. This home is the complete opposite of Aguilera’s usual style since it was a bit more sophisticated “with marbled floors and a stunning chef’s kitchen.” Hopefully, she hasn’t brought the habits from her old mansion into her new mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristen-stewart-leaves-trash-everywhere>Kristen Stewart Leaves&nbsp;Trash Everywhere</h2><p>Her messy house matches her (sometimes) messy hair.&nbsp;<a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a>&nbsp;is allegedly a messy smoker who leaves cigarette butts everywhere. According to Radaronline.com, an insider revealed, “She puffs away like a chimney and leaves cigarette butts everywhere — in the shower, in the potted plants, and once they found one inside the fridge.” Come on. Really? It doesn’t take that much time to simply out a cigarette in an ashtray. Apart from her unkept house, she allegedly has a messy car. In one instance, Daily Mail reported that she was seen leaving a Los Angeles gym and was “driving a rather dirty vehicle.” Her car had so much dust on it that it’s a wonder she was able to see out of the windshield. Years ago, Hollywood Life reported that she admitted to smelling bad. Stewart said, “When I’m nervous, I’m so mindless. I twiddle my thumbs and my hands sweat and I smell bad.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nene-leakes-has-cockroaches>NeNe Leakes Has Cockroaches</h2><p>The Real Housewives star allegedly has a dirty house. A feud between <a href=#>NeNe Leakes</a> and Brielle Biermann has been going on for quite some time now. After Biermann visited Leakes’s new home, she stumbled upon cockroaches. She took a video and posted it on Instagram for all to see. In response, Leakes referred to Biermann as “racist trash” and had other choice words for her. Leakes also has an issue with Biermann’s mother, <a href=#>Kim Zolciak</a>. Zolciak came to her daughter’s defence and stated that “nobody would have seen the cockroach video if Nene hadn’t posted it herself." In an interview with Bravo TV, Leakes revealed some drama that happened at a party she was hosting at her new house. She said, “She turned her nose up at my house. Never gave me one compliment. She talked about how hot it was the whole time, how she couldn’t drink out of my glasses, and just generally complaining about everything.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-octomom-had-cps-called-on-her>The Octomom Had CPS Called On Her</h2><p>The Octomom, who is also known as <a href=#>Nadya Suleman</a>, rose to fame after she gave birth to eight babies all at once. Her home is so disheveled that Child Protective Services made several visits to the house to determine if her kids were safe. The floors and walls were discolored, all of the rooms had trash thrown all over the place, and even dirty diapers were thrown in random places. At one point, her hairstylist contacted Child Protective Services after it was learned that “there was only one working toilet.” CPS was also informed that the kids were allegedly underfed and filthy. In an interview with Inside Edition, Suleman said “It’s kind of messy, but we are a strong, solid family unit, unbeknownst to what many people believe.” Eventually, Suleman had a cleaning crew come to her house after Dr. Drew purchased a year worth of cleaning services so that she could get her life together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-goodger-tried-to-hide-her-messy-room-with-her-cleavage>Lauren Goodger Tried To Hide Her Messy Room With Her Cleavage</h2><p>TV personality and model, Lauren Goodger is also on the list for keeping a messy house. She posted a selfie on Instagram that revealed her curves, but that didn’t stop her fans from seeing her cluttered and messy room. She recently underwent a procedure which left the 31-year old feeling a bit puffy. She compared herself to looking like the Michelin Man. She stated to Closer Magazine, “I look like the Michelin Man! I look like I’m wearing a fat suit.” Even though she felt puffy and swollen, she said that her photos make her look bigger than what she actually is. She said, “I do still feel quite swollen and puffy, but these pictures make me look three times the size I actually am.” Some positive life changes may have led Goodger to eventually do some tidying. According to Daily Mail, she took some time for herself to get household chores done back in November. Hopefully, she keeps it that way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: dailymail.co.uk, insideedition.com, bravotv.com, lifeandstylemag.com, hollywoodlife.com, huffingtonpost.com, curved.com, brobible.com, wikipedia.org, popsugar.com, glamour.com, usmagazine.com, cnn.com, thesun.co.uk, okmagazine.com, radaronline.com, thedailytop.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXZiyrbHBrGSwoJ%2Bosm601KCcZqCforK0ecCrnGaZXam8ta3LZqSeq6Nk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
