Erika was <a href=#>married</a> to another Tom —&nbsp;Thomas Zizzo. The two&nbsp;were married for five years before getting divorced in 1996 — just a couple of months after her son's first birthday. Unlike most divorces, Erika has nothing but nice things to say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about her ex</a>. "I thought I was adult enough to be a wife and a mother, but really I wasn’t. Tommy bore the brunt of that. It was this constant pressure and it was hard for both of us to take," she said in her book Pretty Mess. Tom, on the other hand, has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married two times</a> prior to finding lasting love with Erika.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=erika-is-33-years-his-junior><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Erika Is 33 Years His Junior</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/erika-saying-bye-to-tom.jpg><p>Tom Girardi was born in 1939, making him 33 years old than Miss Erika Jayne who was born in 1971.

In the most recent season of&nbsp;RHOBH, Garcelle brought up the couple's sex life, which Erika answered truthfully.

According to Erika, even though the couple has been married for over 20 years, Tom doesn't wear a wedding band.&nbsp;"A wedding band does not have magical powers. It is not going to stop anyone from doing something," she wrote in&nbsp;<a href=#>Pretty Mess</a>. Furthermore, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom wanted it this way</a>.&nbsp;"Listen, I'll buy you anything you want. I don't care what it is. You name it. But I'm not wearing a wedding band.
