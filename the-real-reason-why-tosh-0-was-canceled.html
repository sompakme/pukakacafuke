It seemed like everything was going along just fine with the show, but this was apparently not the case. The show was given the ax by Comedy Central, and most people may thoroughly dislike the reason why.</p><p><strong>Updated on December 26, 2022:</strong> Since the cancelation of his show, Daniel Tosh has continued to perform standup comedy and go on tours.</p><h2 id=tosh-0-was-a-huge-hit-on-comedy-central>Tosh.0 Was A Huge Hit On Comedy Central</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through the years, Comedy Central has been able to produce a number of shows that have found legions of fans, and most are able to form a unique legacy at the network.</p><p>Back in 2009, Tosh.0 began its time on the network, and few could have predicted just how popular the show would become in a relatively short amount of time.</p><p>The concept of a show featuring a performer giving commentary on viral videos was nothing new at the time, with shows like Web Junk 20 coming around before Tosh.0 made its premiere. However, Tosh’s comedic timing and sense of humor were a perfect fit for the format, and just like that, Comedy Central had a fresh hit on its hands.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Chappelle Goes Hard In Latest Stand-up Special, Free To Watch On YouTube</a></span></p><p>Initially given 10 episodes, things changed quickly for the show, and soon, more episodes were coming down the pipe. This also led to renewals for future seasons of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ball was rolling, and not only was Comedy Central enjoying the benefits of the show’s success, but so was Daniel Tosh, who was already an established stand-up comedian prior to landing on the show.</p><p><a href=#>Daniel even got to work with his wife on the show</a>; she was part of his writing team.</p><p>Through the years, Tosh.0 was chugging along just fine, and it was a legitimate cash cow for Comedy Central. This, of course, led to a lengthy extension.</p><h2 id=tosh-0-was-renewed-for-several-seasons>Tosh.0 Was Renewed For Several Seasons</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/daniel-tosh-on-last-call-with-carson-daly.jpg><p>In January 2020, having already been on the air for over a decade, Tosh.0 was given a huge extension by Comedy Central.</p><p>Normally, shows will be extended for one season at a time, but given its history on the network, Comedy Central wound up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">renewing the show</a> for a whopping four seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unconventional, sure, but there is no point in canceling a good thing, right?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Funniest TV Shows On Comedy Central</a></span></p><p>Everything seemed to be going just fine after the show’s renewal, but by November 2020, things took a drastic turn for the worst when Comedy Central made a huge announcement that no one saw coming.</p><h2 id=the-network-canceled-tosh-earlier-than-planned>The Network Canceled Tosh Earlier Than Planned</h2><p>Tosh.0 was canceled after more than a decade on the air, and people were in disbelief that the network would pull the plug on the show. After all, it was a monumental success and the network showed what appeared to be good faith by renewing the show for four more years.</p><p>Turns out, they had other plans that they put into action swiftly. According to The Hollywood Reporter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there was a huge shift going on at Comedy Central</a> in terms of their programming, and this is what caused the decision to ax the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The network planned to lean heavily into adult animation, animated reboots, and topical shows. Tosh simply wasn't a good fit for the new direction of the channel.</p><p>The official statement noted that Daniel's form of comedy didn't fit its new vision; contrary to popular belief, his show wasn't canceled simply because of his jokes, which are often labeled offensive.</p><h2 id=what-is-daniel-tosh-up-to-today>What Is Daniel Tosh Up To Today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/daniel-tosh-standup-comedy.jpg><p>Daniel Tosh has remained in the limelight despite his Comedy Central series being canceled.

Tosh continues to do standup and goes on comedy tours; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his website outlines tour dates through 2023</a>, though fans can expect him to continue beyond that, too.</p><p>And though Tosh is married, <a href=#>he and his wife don't seem to be in a big hurry to have kids</a>—meaning there's plenty of time to work on his comedy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6uLTYZquoq5hifW7DwKxknJmemLKtscNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
