Then again, likely not.”</p><p>She noted: “You’d sense that the story was not over, but certainly was in a different chapter, and that their plot lines had forever diverged.”</p><p>In keeping with her Instagram comment, Leasure mentioned the effects of the relationship. “In some sense they owed their lives to each other, were living the after shocks of the decisions they had once made,” she wrote.</p><p>Miller and Leasure began dating in high school but split in 2016. The “Self Care” rapper moved on with <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>, but&nbsp;Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed their breakup</a> in May after nearly two years together.</p><p>The Los Angeles Police Department told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;Miller was pronounced dead at his San Fernando Valley area home on Friday after authorities responded to a call before noon. His death came months after he was <a href=#>arrested for driving under the influence</a>.</p><p>His <a href=#>family released a statement</a> to TMZ following his death: “Malcolm McCormick known and adored by fans as Mac Miller, has tragically passed away at the age of 26. He was a bright light in this world for his family, friends and fans.
