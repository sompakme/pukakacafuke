On Wednesday (July 27) and what would have been his 37th birthday, his fiancée Mia Jaye, read a heartfelt, tear-jerking letter in a sentimental Instagram video to the late love of her life.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Having experienced grief through and through, I can truly testify to Bill Spence’s explanation that grief is really just love with nowhere to go,” Jaye captioned her tribute video featuring her and their children. “It is truly the essence of all the love you want to give but can’t. But I choose to express every ounce of my love for those whom I love because it can’t stay bottled up inside.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She concluded, “So yesterday, tomorrow and especially today my family and I will celebrate the man affectionately known as Daddy in our home and Dolph to the world. Happy Birthday Daddy, we forever love you [blue heart emoji].”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the letter, Jaye spoke about how her family has been “blemished” since his death and the development of their children. Jaye described her coping as a heavy load to carry and ended the letter thanking Dolph for allowing her to experience “a genuine soul-tied love.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Young Dolph&nbsp;and Mia Jaye&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>reportedly</a> began their romantic relationship 10 years ago. Two years after meeting in Memphis, the couple welcomed their son, Tre, two years later. In 2017, their daughter, Ari, was born. Mia, who has always confidently referred to Dolph as her soulmate, has always been vocal about the love she shares for him and the family they’ve created.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=#>Young Dolph was shot and killed</a> on Nov. 17, 2021, while visiting&nbsp;Makeda’s Homemade Cookies&nbsp;in Memphis. Since then, Mia has taken steps to further advocate&nbsp;for victims and families who’ve experienced loss due to senseless crimes. After the fatal shooting of her brother, she initiated the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Black Men Deserve to Grow Old campaign</a>&nbsp;in 2020.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Read Mia Jaye’s open letter to her late fiancé below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dear Adolph,</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This is the year that our favorite numbers come together. Three and seven. This is also the first year we don’t have the opportunity to celebrate you together. Over the past eight months, life has been strange. Our beautiful family is blemished and myself, Tre and Ari can’t go a day without reminiscing how beautiful life was with you. Ari tells everyone how amazing her dad was and how much he loved his chocolate baby.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">‘Daddy, I love you. Make sure you have a great birthday. Love, your chocolate baby.’</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Tre is coming into that special young man you always spoke that he’d become. He admires you in every way and most days, I feel like he is the reincarnated version of you.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">‘Dad, thank you for having me as a son. I try to do my best to be a good brother. Amen.’</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for me, the load is so heavy. I miss everything about us and all that we shared. I often wish I could turn back time or do anything to still have you in the flesh, but I push past all the heavy and emotional thoughts and just focus on all the many ways I can honor, acknowledge and make you proud.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">I love you even after the end of time and I thank you for allowing me to experience a genuine soul-tied love for as long as we did. Happy heavenly birthday, my love.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Mia</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX668trrGZpuopKCdeqe1wKeanp1dl7azwMedmLJlnJrBtbHRZmhra2RrhXKBkG9m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
