Darren’s claim that he is 19 was most likely made to give him a better chance at Discord E-dating competitions, but otherwise he wouldn’t disclose his real age.</p><p>However, on a video he made on December 22, 2020 doing a Q&A, he said (at the time) he was 15, turning 16 “in a minute”, thus making this argument technically useless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjnby4v8%2BenJ1lp564qnnBoqZmmZeaerOxy6KeoqeeYrWmtcahq2avlZ60qcCMpqarnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
