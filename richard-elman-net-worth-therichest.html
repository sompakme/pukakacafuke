Since November 2011, he has been the acting Chief Executive Officer of the firm. His current earnings has been down due to the falling value of his shared in the Hong Kong-based company.</p><p>In order to cope with the fall in his stakes, Elman has imposed a new growth strategy by venturing into the natural gas market in the United States. With the decrease in the U.S. energy prices, given the shale gas boom, he has opened for Noble to sell natural gas from America to Asia and Europe.</p><p>Richard Elman may have been ruled out of his retirement but he is still actively involved in the company. Noble may have appointed Goldman Sachs banker Yusuf Alireza as its CEO last year but Elman still has his voice in the group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before launching Noble Group in1986, Richard Elman has worked for ten years with Phibro.
