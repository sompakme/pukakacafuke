But Ford has been tired of Star Wars from day one. Ford didn't necessarily hate his time in the galaxy far far away, he just put up with it, albeit grudgingly sometimes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, Ford's entry into the galaxy came almost out of pure luck. Ford had starred in George Lucas' American Graffiti, and later on, when Lucas was just about to make Star Wars, Ford was still working as a carpenter and had been asked to make a door at the studio. According to CBR, Lucas was trying to cast his three leading stars in groups, to see how they interacted together. So he had five Leias, five Lukes, but only four Hans, and when Lucas saw Ford he had him join the group that was missing a Han and the rest is history.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harrison Ford&nbsp;At 77 Years Old: Everything There Is To Know</a></span></p><p>"I had helped George Lucas audition other actors for the principle [sic] parts, and with no expectation or indication that I might be considered for the part of Han, I was quite surprised when I was offered the part. My principle [sic] job at the time was carpentry," Ford said during a Reddit AMA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ford-3.jpg><p>So Ford went on to be one of the best characters in Star Wars, alongside Fisher and Hamill, thinking (even though he sort of changes his answer every time he's asked), that Star Wars was going to be no huge success. Han has some of the most famous lines in the whole franchise, but something about the character always bugged Ford, and&nbsp;in&nbsp;Empire Strikes Back he started wanting his character's storyline changed. From the famous "I love you," "I know" scene where he wanted to change his lines to wanting Solo to die at the end of Return of the Jedi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Han gets put into carbonite at the end of Empire Strikes Back, Ford wanted that to be the last time we see the hero, but when that didn't happen, he instead tried to convince Lucas to kill Han in the last episode of the trilogy. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starpulse</a> Ford said, "I did think the character itself was relatively thin. I would have liked to see some complication for the character; the only complication I didn’t get was to die at the end of the third one. I thought that would have given the whole film a bottom, but I couldn’t talk George into it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ford-4.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So Return of the Jedi saw Han survive, and by the looks of it, Ford was off the hook and was no longer needed as Solo, but that didn't stop him from disliking the character years later. In another interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Ford said "He's got a good heart but I think he’s certainly a much less interesting character than Indiana Jones. He’s dumb as a stump... The breadth of his story utility was never extensive. He was the foil between the other more compelling elements of the film, between the sage old warrior and the young hero. There’s not much breadth of character to explore beyond what we got out of him."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How George Lucas Really Wanted The Original Star Wars Trilogy To End</a></span></p><p>When Return of the Jedi finished, Ford washed his hands of the character and told the Today show that he was glad to never see his Solo costume again. "Three’s enough for me," he said. "I was glad to see that costume for the last time." In 2010, Ford was asked whether he'd like to reprise his role, the actor said, "No, no, no. Han Solo was very good to me at a certain point in my career. But I’m done. I’m done with him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Until Force Awakens. Well in the end, at least Ford got to see his character die, whether he was actually happy to see it happen by that time, he got his wish. When asked back to reprise his role, he ironically accepted despite the many times he said he wouldn't. "It should have felt ridiculous!" Ford <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to being asked about returning to&nbsp;Force Awakens at a Comic-Con panel. "Here I was, doing something I did so long ago."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ford-5.jpeg><p>Ford has had an epic back and forth battle of being indifferent to Star Wars, and when he reprised his role in Force Awakens&nbsp;he seemed to be a bit more into it, but when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a> if he thought John Boyega would be taking the torch left by Han, Ford said, "I don't know that I thought of it that way at all. I was there to die. And I didn't really give a rat's ass who got my sword."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Ford was on set of Force Awakens, and he shot his scene entering the Millenium Falcon for the first time since he last played the character, Lucasfilm president, Kathleen Kennedy said there were about 200 people in the studio that day to watch it happen. But of course, the moment wasn't at all that special to Ford.</p><p>Whether Ford really dislikes Star Wars and Han Solo remains to be seen. During the Comic-Con panel, where he was reunited with the other legacy players, he did say reprising his role was great. But somehow clips of Ford angrily destroying a Han doll and another of him tossing a LEGO Millenium Falcon to smithereens will always sit in a very sad part of our minds forever. But Ford is just as much a scruffy-looking Nerfherder as Han.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Details Most Star Wars Fans Don't Know About The Sequel Trilogy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmn5qqop7AsLqMn6arnF2ZtqW602ajoqOVYrWqv4ytoKadXaS7br%2FTmqlmr5GnwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
