Louis Vuitton inscribes their print all over their bags, making them easy to spot. Some other bags ditch the flash and go for understated elegance. It's hard to identify a Hermès Birkin from a distance, yet it's one of the most coveted bags among women everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just so you know, it'll be foolhardy to attempt popping down to the nearest store to buy one. First, you have to try to get on a waiting list, of up to five years, in some stores. Having the cash simply isn't enough for you to get one. Approaching a store assistant, even with cash in hand, will be met with a polite “Not available”. What he/she really means is “Not available for you, mere mortal."</p><p>You'll never find Birkins waiting on shelves. That's why there's a thriving pre-owned market for these bags. Pre-owned doesn't equal cheap though; a pre-owned Hermès Courchevel Birkin 32 costs $6,500. If you want to go all out, the Hermès Two-Tone Crocodile Birkin 35 costs $55,000.00.</p><p>But let's say you get the gift of a Birkin but are in two minds about spending so much on a bag. Since Birkins range in price, we'll be using a range to show you what you can spend the money on instead. We'll be using bags on the 'cheap' end costing $9,000+, all the way to 'A-list' Birkins of $150,000+.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-100-000---150-000-does-it-go-fast-check><strong>10.

The SeaBreacher is a submersible hybrid boat that allows you enjoy the thrill of speed while doing some insane tricks. The 260 hp supercharged engine allows you do barrel rolls, 90-degree 'jumps' straight out of the water and so much more. The streamlined hull covered in custom eye-catching designs can be yours for $100,000.</p><p>For those days when you can't decide on hitting the waves&nbsp;or going off-roading, the $125,000 WaterCar Panther has got you covered. An amphibious craft capable of up to 45 mph on water and 80 mph on land, the Panther is guaranteed to make any trip to the water tons&nbsp;of fun. Both&nbsp;of these items&nbsp;can be easily purchased from&nbsp;$150,000 you would have used for the Emerald Green Blue Izmir Crocodile Hermès.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-10-000---70-000-tick-tock-time-s-up><strong>9.

How about a recognizable timepiece like a Rolex? A pre-owned Rolex Datejust Diamond Bezel Jubilee Bracelet Ladies Watch costs $9,995.</p><p>For a brand new Rolex, be prepared to shell out up to $20, 000 for the Rolex Datejust Automatic in 18kt Yellow Gold. Looking for a bolder design? Try the Rolex 18k Yellow Gold Yachtmaster II, for only $29,000.</p><p>Staggered by those prices? Don't be.

Thanks to the Internet, it doesn't have to remain a dream. Trawling through eBay, you'll find some gems that will make you quickly debate&nbsp;the idea of&nbsp;that $50,000 Hermès. Yes, a lot of these classic motors can be bought for 50k or less.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Take the&nbsp;classic muscle car, the 1966 Pontiac GTO. One was&nbsp;lovingly restored to almost mint condition. It's so close to it's original condition that the International Show Car Association ranked it “the 19th best restored car” in the USA. And it's under 50k.</p><p>Another classic that has been restored and ready for you to pick up is this<i> '</i>69 Mercedes 280SL Roadster. In its original Signal Red over Black trim, this Merc comes with its original factory build card, books, tools; everything to keep it true to its classic roots. The price is the best part; less than $40,000!</p><p></p><h2 id=7-5-000---15-000-pimp-your-home><strong>7.&nbsp; ($ 5,000 - $ 15,000) Pimp Your Home</strong></h2><p>via;www.digitaltrends.com</p><p>Want to splash some cash on your castle, but don't know where to start? While you can upgrade your home by installing smart, Internet-connected appliances, that can add up&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>So let's start in the kitchen; brands like Sub-Zero start at $6,000 for a 36” Side-by-Side Refrigerator. Even with the $10,000 cost of the&nbsp;Hermès Two-Tone Birkin 40 , that can get expensive fast!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the den, forget off-the-shelf home theater solutions. A custom DIY home theater system can be set up for well under $ 10, 000. It even comes with a vintage popcorn maker, your own 3.1-cubic-foot steel beverage cooler and leaves you with loads of cash to spare!

Here's a plan: take a bunch of friends and see Europe on a river boat. It only costs $1,500 per person for a seven night cruise.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If privacy is your thing, you can hire your own luxury yacht.

Setting up a donor-advised fund allows you start with as little as you want, and make donations to non-profits of your choosing. It also provides an avenue for an immediate tax deduction of up to 30%.</p><p>Regardless of the size of your investment, you can make a difference if you choose to donate to charity.
