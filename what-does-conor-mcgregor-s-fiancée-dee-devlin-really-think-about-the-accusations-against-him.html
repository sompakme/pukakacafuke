A world-famous fighter that most people think is a first-ballot UFC Hall of Famer, McGregor has proven time and time again that fans are willing to pay big bucks to watch him do his thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/conor-mcgregor.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also known for his colorful style and personality, McGregor had Hollywood knocking on his door in a big way at one point. Set to star in an upcoming action movie, <a href=#>the deal McGregor signed to headline the Road House remake</a> was remarkable.</p><p>However, despite all the success that McGregor has enjoyed in life, the fact is that many people don't focus on that for valid reasons. An extremely controversial figure, many people understandably focus on the accusations McGregor has faced.</p><p>In June 2023, Game 4 of the NBA Finals took place in Miami. A massive event for sports fans all over the world, many celebrities attended the game and came to Miami to take part in the nightlife that followed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Could Armie Hammer Sue For Defamation After Losing Work Due To Assault Accusations?</a></span></p><p>When Game 4 was held at the Kaseya Center in Miami, 20,184 were in attendance according to Wikipedia. Two of those people were Conor McGregor and the woman that accused him of doing something atrocious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to McGregor's accuser, she was partying in the same club where the famous fighter was that is in Kaseya Center following the game. Then, the two of them went into a bathroom where she says that <a href=#>McGregor forced himself on her</a>.</p><p>Immediately after the accuser's lawyer Ariel Mitchell made the allegations public, McGregor denied the claims through a statement put out by his lawyer. "The allegations are false. Mr McGregor will not be intimidated."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/conor-mcgregor-and-dee-devlin-wearing-black.jpg><p>After the accusations about that night went public, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a notable detail of the original claims was refuted by security footage</a> that was released. On top of that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">footage of McGregor and his accuser interacting</a> a half hour after she says the crime happened was obtained by TMZ Sports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, it is known that victims of traumatic events can have fragmented and incomplete memories. On top of that, since the accuser's lawyer spoke on her behalf, there could have been a miscommunication. The accuser's lawyer addressed the footage of her interacting with McGregor later in the night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/conor-mcgregor-and-his-fianc-e-dee-devlin-at-an-event.jpg><p>"My client has always stated that there would be video of before and after, and in those videos she emphasized that the difference in the interactions between them would be visibly noticeable. This again is another video that supports what my client has been saying and supports what she told the police since the inception of this incident."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Allegations Against Nicholas Braun Suggest A Far More Scandalous Dating Life Than He's Led Fans To Believe, But Is Any Of It True?</a></span></p><p>As of the time of this writing, the Miami Police Department continues to investigate the accusations against McGregor. Furthermore, representatives of the police say that the investigation could take "weeks" to complete, according to TMZ Sports.</p><p>In the meantime, McGregor and his accuser remain in limbo waiting to see what will come of the investigation. Never one to back down from anything, McGregor appears to be going about his regular life since the accusations were made against him.</p><p>While McGregor's fans likely assumed he would react that way, observers were curious about someone else in his life. How would McGregor's fiancée and the mother of his three children, Dee Devlin, react to the accusations made against him?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/conor-mcgregor-and-dee-devlin-all-dressed-up.jpg><p>Even though McGregor is such an outspoken person, his fiancée has never been the kind of person to seek the spotlight. With that in mind, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Devlin hasn't spoken out about the accusations against McGregor.</p><p>After the allegations against McGregor were made public, Devlin seemingly let her actions speak for her. A couple of weeks after the accusations garnered headlines, Devlin flew to New York City <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to spend Father's Day with McGregor</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/what-does-conor-mcgregor-s-fianc-dee-devlin-really-think-about-the-accusations-against-him_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it could be argued that Devlin went to New York City so her kids could spend Father's Day with their dad. However, photos McGregor posted on Instagram appeared to show Devlin giving him a foot massage. In reality, nobody knows how Devlin feels about the accusations and what the dynamics are like in her relationship with McGregor, but people read into those photos.</p><h2 id=conor-mcgregor-39-s-history-of-controversies>Conor McGregor's History Of Controversies</h2><p>Years before Conor McGregor was accused of committing an atrocious crime following Game 4 of the 2023 NBA Finals, he was already getting into trouble. Looking back at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the timeline of McGregor's scandals,</a> the amount of times he has gotten into trouble is astounding.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker's Relationship With Chris Noth Seems To Have Changed Following The Controversial Allegations</a></span></p><p>Since 2017, McGregor has repeatedly gotten in trouble for a myriad of driving offenses, according to People. Between speeding, driving without a license, and more, McGregor has been fined and had to go to court repeatedly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On multiple occasions, McGregor has gotten into trouble after being accused of assaults. Given what McGregor has done for a living, you'd certainly think everyone would do whatever they could to avoid fighting him in the streets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/conor-mcgregor-interviwed-outsite-a-brooklyn-court.jpg><p>In 2019, McGregor grabbed and smashed the phone of a fan who was trying to take his photo. Ultimately McGregor didn't face any charges from this incident, but he spent hours behind bars after he was arrested for criminal mischief and strong-armed robbery, according to The Daily Mail.</p><p>Since 2018, two other women have made claims similar to the accusations that were made against him after Game 4 of the NBA Finals. In both of those cases, McGregor denied any wrongdoing, and he ultimately didn't face criminal charges from either accusation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmmqimn6d6rq%2FGq5ygp6Koeqe1wKeanp1dmbKmecOeraWhnmLBqbXNpGSamp%2BqwW6twpysrJmknryvv4yanpqhnqjBbrTIpmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
