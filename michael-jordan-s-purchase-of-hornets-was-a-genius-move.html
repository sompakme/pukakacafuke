Following the 2005-06 campaign, three years after playing his final NBA season, Jordan joined the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) ownership group, having purchased a small stake. In 2010, Jordan bought the team from Bob Johnson for approximately $180 million.
Now, the Hornets haven't experienced much success on the court under Jordan's ownership."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They've only made the playoffs twice since the 2010-11 season, having last accomplished the feat in 2016.</p><p>The team hasn't won a single postseason series since returning to the NBA in 2004-05, either. The old Hornets team last one a playoff series in 2002, before relocating to New Orleans (now the Pelicans) in the 2002-03 season.</p><p>But as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick Bonnell of the Charlotte Observer</a> notes, MJ's purchase of the Hornets was a genius investment. After spending less than one-fifth of a billion to become full owner, Jordan has seen a rapid increase in the Hornets' value.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knicks Owner James Dolan Says He's Not Selling Team</a></strong></p><p>The team is now worth $1.5 billion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes </a>reported on their most recent NBA team valuations list. That places Charlotte 25th on the list, but Jordan has enjoyed a massive growth in value nonetheless. The team was only worth $780 million back in 2017.</p><p>The Hornets are on their sixth head coach (James Borrego) dating back to 2010. Despite a plethora of top 10 draft picks over the year, the Hornets haven't been able to land enough big-named stars to build a winner. It doesn't help playing in a smaller market, considering that many of the top players are joining big market clubs to build superteams in places like Brooklyn, Houston, Los Angeles and Boston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Obviously, Jordan would love to see a winner on the court. This is a man who won six NBA Championships over an eight-year span in the '90s, after all. But from a business standpoint, his investment of the Hornets was a Grade-A choice. He's among the few athletes to achieve billionaire status, after all.</p><p><strong>Next: <a href=#>Release Date Revealed For Westworld Season 3 Along With New Trailer</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6qq%2FHmpylZZqkv6WtzWanrqqTna60sYyonWagn6e7psDSZqSaop%2BnerG%2Bzp%2BgrWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
