Like … I can’t get in a relationship right now.”</p><p>She asserted that <a href=#>she wanted to “just have fun”</a> and see where things go. “I don’t know, a lot of [the guys] are really young and that’s kind of fun too,” she told Us. “I’m kind of, like, in a cougar era. … I can date the young one, [someone] my age and the young one’s dad. So I kind of love that for me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Taken-Katie-Maloneys-25-Year-Old-Beau-Revealed-After-Tom-Schwartz-Split.jpg><p>The Bravo personality exchanged vows with Schwartz, 40, in 2016 but <a href=#>the ceremony wasn’t official</a> since they failed to obtain a marriage license. The twosome legally tied the knot in 2019, and the former SUR waitress <a href=#>announced via Instagram in March</a> that she and Schwartz called it quits.</p><p>The Tom Tom co-owner issued a statement of his own at the time, writing in a lengthy social media post: “Well this sucks. How am I supposed to capture 12 years of love in a f—kin canned Instagram caption. I’m not the victim. Not gonna write too sad a song. Fully respect Katie’s decision and we’ve had healthy, productive conversations about it. It would be far sadder if she decided to stay with me whilst not happy.”</p><p>Days after their split made headlines, <a href=#>the Utah native officially filed for divorce</a>. Us confirmed earlier this month that the proceedings were finalized. The exes are splitting the profits from the August sale of their California home, which left the market at $2 million, and are dividing the rest of their assets based on what is in each person’s name.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href=#>Maloney shed more light</a> on the reason she and Schwartz pulled the plug on their relationship, explaining that <a href=#>she “had to really start prioritizing” her own needs</a>. “It got to a point where I just felt like I was going to burst,” she said on her “You’re Gonna Love Me” podcast. “For months, it was building up. I felt just disconnected. I felt like I was drifting further and further away.”</p><p>She continued: “The best and only way I can describe it is just waking up and having this voice that just became louder and louder.”</p><p>While Maloney is dating outside of her inner circle, <a href=#>her ex-husband hooked up</a> with fellow Pump Rules star <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>. After rumors swirled that <a href=#>the twosome kissed at Coachella</a> in April — which Schwartz denied — Us confirmed that <a href=#>the duo “made out” at <strong>Scheana Shay</strong> and <strong>Brock Davies</strong></a>‘ wedding in August.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was so caught up in my own little world and I was married — I never took time to get to know Raquel,” the bar owner later told Shay, 37, on <a href=#>her “Scheananigans” podcast</a>. “She was always cool. I just never really took [the] time to invest in her. That’s a horrible way to phrase it. I never really gave her a chance. … She has so much depth and character. I think I wrote her off.”</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoJ9itrR5ypqrop1doq6tu82esGackam2r7OMmp2tnaJiwbC5jKyaoa%2BRp8G7ecOiraiqk5p6pbHTmqClq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
