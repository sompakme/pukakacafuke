For now, the character is yet to be introduced into the MCU. That said, fans can’t still forget the Harry that they witnessed in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (which stars Andrew Garfield as the web slinger). Since then, however, not much is known about the actor later transformed into the Green Goblin.</p><h2 id=who-portrayed-harry-osborn-in-lsquo-the-amazing-spider-man-2-rsquo>Who Portrayed Harry Osborn In ‘The Amazing Spider-Man 2’?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>James Franco took on the role of Harry in the Tobey Maguire-led Spider-Man trilogy</a>, it was Dane DeHaan who was tapped to portray the character in Sony’s Spider-Man reboot. The actor made his film debut just a few years before joining the superhero franchise, starring alongside Oscar winner Chris Cooper in the 2010 war drama Amigo. Around the same time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeHaan also landed a part in the HBO series In Treatment</a>, which is headlined by Uzo Aduba and Gabriel Byrne.</p><p>That said, DeHaan breakout role came in just a couple of years later in the 2012 sci-fi drama Chronicle. In the movie, the actor, along with co-stars Michael B. Jordan and Alex Russell, play high school seniors who end up with telekinetic powers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Sally Field Really Had To Say About Playing The Amazing Spider-Man's Aunt May</a></span></p><p>As it turns out, however, it wasn’t his performance in Amigo that got Chronicle director Josh Trank’s attention but rather, his tv role. “Dane DeHaan was one of our first picks,” Trank told Complex. “He really felt like the kind of actor who could carry a performance where you have sympathy for him, but you’re also kind of afraid of him snapping and losing control.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, since then, the actor also went on to star in films such as Lawless, Kill Your Darlings, Life After Beth, Devil’s Knot, and the crime drama The Place Beyond the Pines with Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, Ryan Gosling, and Ray Liotta.</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-what-dane-dehaan-has-been-up-to-since-playing-harry-osborn>Here’s What Dane DeHaan Has Been Up To Since Playing Harry Osborn</h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after wrapping up on The Amazing Spider-Man 2, DeHaan moved on to several other film projects. Among them is Gore Verbinski’s fantasy horror A Cure For Wellness, which also stars Jason Isaacs and Mia Goth. And as it turns out, it was one of DeHaan’s pre-Spider-Man performances that caught Verbinski’s attention.</p><p>“I've just always been a fan of his and I saw him in a small part in A Place Beyond the Pines, and was immediately, ‘Who's that?’” Verbinski told Collider. “I wanted to put him in my next movie and find a part for him. As we started developing The Cure, I couldn't get him out of my head for the role.”</p><p>Not long after, DeHaan also landed the lead role in Luc Besson’s adventure fantasy Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. The cast also includes Cara Delevingne, Rihanna, Clive Owen, and Ethan Hawke. Based on a comic book series, DeHaan stars as Major Valerian, one of the special operatives who embarks on a mission to save Alpha, a metropolis that’s home to species from a thousand planets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For DeHaan, he was more than happy to do the film since it’s always been a dram of his to work with Besson. “It was the phone call that every actor wants to get – that a visionary director is making THE movie that he has wanted to make his entire life and he wants you to star in it,” the actor told Heavy Mag.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are Andrew Garfield's Most Profitable Movies (Besides The Amazing Spider-Man)</a></span></p><p>Following Lisey’s Story, DeHaan stars in the upcoming HBO Max limited series The Staircase. The cast also includes Colin Firth, Sophie Turner, Toni Collette, Rosemarie DeWitt, and Patrick Schwarzenegger. The series is based on the high-profile murder case surrounding American novelist Michael Petersen who is portrayed by Firth. Meanwhile, DeHaan plays his son, Clayton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeHaan also recently joined the cast of Christopher Nolan’s upcoming biopic Oppenheimer</a>. The film also boasts of a cast that includes Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Michael Angarano, Josh Hartnett, and Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer.</p><p>Aside from this, DeHaan is also attached to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another upcoming biopic, McCarthy</a>. The cast also includes Emilia Clarke, Scoot McNairy, and Oscar nominee Michael Shannon as former politician Joseph McCarthy.</p><p>And in case anyone is wondering if DeHaan is willing to join the MCU anytime soon, fans may be disappointed to learn that the actor has long moved on from this superhero world. “At this point in my life, I’d much rather do something new,” he told The Playlist. “They’re super fun to make and an incredible thing to be a part of. But I don’t think I’d want to go back and do something I did seven years ago…”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>15 Ways The Amazing Spider-Man Movies Are Better Than The New Ones</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZ2us77YZqasmp%2Bnu26tzJqxoqaXYsCxtcOeqWalkaN6c3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
