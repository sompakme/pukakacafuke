“I am one month postpartum and one thing that I really wanted to try to stay on top of was my hair health,” Meissner, 38, shared in a since-expired Instagram Story on Thursday, October 19, per People. “I’m a hairstylist so I have seen it all, and I really wanted to make sure that I got on some kind of daily routine to make sure that I didn’t have a whole lot of thinning [or] shedding."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here’s to a thick girl summer,” she wrote at the time.</p><p>In August 2018, Meissner told then-Southern Charm costar <a href=#><strong>Cameran Eubanks</strong></a> that she wasn’t sure if she wanted to have children — but she may be open to it eventually.</p><p>“That’s not ever anything I just sit and think about,” Meissner said on the Southern Charm After Show at the time. “But now I’ve seen [Cameran] with a child and how much she loves <a href=#>Palmer</a>. So I hate to say never; that’s where I am now. But if someone comes along that changes my mind, then it happens. But I can’t imagine that really for me. I got lucky with my dog — I have the best dog — so if I had a kid, it’d probably be awful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Southern-Charm-Alum-Chelsea-Meissner-Gives-Birth-to-1st-Baby-2.jpg><p>Meissner got her start on reality TV in 2012 on<a href=#> Survivor 24: One World</a>. She ended the show in third place. Nearly five years later, Meissner joined the cast of Southern Charm in its fourth season and became a main cast member for seasons 5 and 6.</p><p>During her stint on the show, Meissner had a brief romance with costar <a href=#><strong>Austen Kroll</strong></a> in 2017. One year later, Kroll, 36, seemingly hinted there was no spark between him and Meissner ahead of their split. “I need a woman with sex drive,” Kroll wrote via Instagram after a fan claimed he didn’t try hard enough with his former castmate.</p><p>In May 2020, Southern Charm alum <a href=#><strong>Naomie Olindo</strong></a> revealed that she and Meissner were <a href=#>leaving the Bravo show</a> after Eubanks’ exit on the heels of fake cheating rumors.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m so damn proud of you and us @chelseameissner58,” Olindo, 31, who later returned to the show, commented on Eubanks’ Instagram post about quitting the Bravo series at the time.</p><p>Since exiting the show ahead of season 7, Meissner has continued her work as a hairstylist in South Carolina.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasp6Wptaa%2BzWaaoZmionqiuNSmZJyglaHApq2Mppyiq6OjsrN5xqKtnqtdl7azwMdmq6hlYajBbq7Am7Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
