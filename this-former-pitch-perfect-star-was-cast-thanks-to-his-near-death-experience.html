With a cast of the most talented musical artists from different backgrounds and experiences, there is only a tiny chance of getting in if you are a newbie. Luckily for Adam DeVine, his near-death experience helped him get the role of Bumper in Pitch Perfect and Pitch Perfect 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What happened to Adam DeVine? How did Adam's inspirational story help him get into the Pitch Perfect cast? Is Adam DeVine still suffering from his traumatic experience in the past? Keep reading to find out...</p><h2 id=what-was-adam-devine-39-s-accident>What Was Adam DeVine's Accident?</h2><p>Adam DeVine was only 11 years old when he experienced an accident that almost took his life. One day, as he was walking along the streets of Omaha, Nebraska, holding his bike beside him, a 42-ton cement truck that was in convoy with three other trucks collided with him. The force was strong enough to immediately catapult the young Adam underneath the truck while dragging him up to five hundred feet across the road.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only were his injuries and scars grave enough, but he also suffered a temporary coma resulting from acute shock. To make his situation worse, he found out the impact of getting dragged and rolled over by the truck's wheels broke all his leg bones alongside multiple infections that required him to undergo 26 surgeries. Adam also had multiple organ failures and was at a very high risk of nearly getting his legs amputated because of their severity.</p><p>Medical professionals told him that the likelihood of him being able to walk was slim, and he had to live most, if not all, the remaining years of his life in a wheelchair. Adam was honest in telling interviews that it felt like he hit rock bottom because of how poorly his physical situation was. On top of his physical scars, being 11 years old and mentally dealing with all the trauma and isolation also took a toll on his mental health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-devine-39-s-inspirational-story>Adam DeVine's Inspirational Story</h2><p><a href=#>Adam DeVine's tragic event almost took his life</a>, and he would not have ended up playing the role of Andy in Modern Family or Bumper in Pitch Perfect.</p><p>To help himself stay sane while going through all the years of physical therapy and recovery, he found listening to local radio stations a great pastime; that was when he found out he enjoyed voice impersonating celebrities. When he eventually returned to school, he experienced bullying because of his injuries and scars. Still, the young DeVine only deflected the insults by making a comedic scene out of the celebrity impersonations he had learned.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why These Modern Family Stars Hated The Show And The Wonderful Thing That Happened As A Result</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His learned talent in impersonating helped him develop his talent for performing, especially singing. Adam's talent later on paved the way for his Hollywood career, making it possible for him to be part of the Pitch Perfect cast.</p><p>Adam DeVine's career blossomed after his stint in Pitch Perfect. <a href=#>Adam also had a breakthrough career in Workaholics</a>, followed by his appearances in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Orange Is the New Black</a>.</p><h2 id=who-did-adam-devine-date-from-pitch-perfect>Who Did Adam DeVine Date From Pitch Perfect?</h2><p>Although <a href=#>Adam DeVine and co-star Rebel Wilson had a strong friendship thanks to Pitch Perfect</a>, Adam dated his co-artist Chloe Bridges who he also met on set. Before being in a relationship with his now-wife, Adam focused more on growing his professional career; that's why falling in love with her was not in his preliminary plans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adam and Chloe didn't start with an immediate spark, as he admitted on their wedding day. Because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam was intimidated by Chloe's beauty</a>, he often played Fruit Nina instead of talking to her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anna Kendrick Refused To Wear Edgier Clothing For Pitch Perfect, Here's What She Said</a></span></p><p>Adam DeVine adds, "I was a total weirdo. She [Chloe Bridges] was like, 'What are you doing?' I kept telling her this would be the best day ever." Eventually, things started becoming serious between them after their work in Pitch Perfect in 2015, leading to their marriage in 2019.</p><h2 id=what-is-adam-devine-doing-now>What is Adam DeVine Doing Now?</h2><p>Adam DeVine has been enjoying his time with his newly wedded wife, Chloe Bridges, since October 2019 after having a few more breakthrough roles in When We First Met, where he served as both an actor and producer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Adam DeVine is usually known for a supporting or guest role in tv shows and films, his work in Workaholics positively impacted his career. Adam's relatively more significant role in Workaholics made comedy fans recognize his talent as the show's main character. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam also started getting involved in show production along with Blake Anderson, Kyle Newacheck, and Anders Holm, who were also writers in Workaholic.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'Workaholics' Cast Member Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>﻿Aside from the comedy sitcom Workaholics, he also became the producer for The Freak Brothers, an animated show featuring other well-known voice artists such as Pete Davidson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adam DeVine is still active in Hollywood, acting and getting involved behind the scenes.
