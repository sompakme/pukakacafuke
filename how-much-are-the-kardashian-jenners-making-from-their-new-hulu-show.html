It started when Kris' friend pitched the reality show as a solution to their family's financial issues. "So many people have said to me for years and years: 'You should really have your own reality show, because your life is so crazy,'" said <a href=#>the momager</a>.</p><p>"My girlfriend Kathie Lee Gifford used to always tell me, 'You're really our reality show. People don't even know what's happening here.' And that was when the big kids were babies. It's always been something that people were throwing around. And then when Deena [Katz, casting director] came over, I think a light bulb just went off for both of us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> </strong>also said that it felt natural to them to share their lives on TV. "I just remember it happening so fast. And we really didn't know what was going on. But it was fun," she said. "Once the show got picked up, we kind of as a family made a pact that we were always going to just be ourselves." She added that some of her family members, including herself, have always wanted to break into reality TV. "<strong><a href=#>Kourtney</a></strong> had already done a show called Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive and our stepdad did I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!" <a href=#>the Skims founder</a> shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And then they were going to do a show called I'm a Rich Kid... Get Me Out of Here, and it was gonna be like celebrities' kids doing the jungle thing. And I was going to do that, but then the show got canceled," Kim continued. "And so my mom knew that I really wanted to do a reality show. Since The Real World came out, I was always really into reality TV. We'd had this conversation. And so even though I had a job, and I was working at my dad's office, she knew that was something I was into. So it was more like me and her kind of into it. And then, once it was a family show, that was what made sense. And that's what seemed to get our attention."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Kim Kardashian Pete Davidson's Oldest Girlfriend?</a></span></p><h2 id=kardashian-jenners-39-salary-in-hulu-39-s-39-the-kardashians-39>Kardashian-Jenners' Salary In Hulu's 'The Kardashians'</h2><p>Insiders recently revealed that the Kardashian-Jenners are making nine figures from their new Hulu show. <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> said they're all earning the same salary. "We're all equals," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Variety</a>. Kris also admitted that many other networks had asked them to continue their show. But at the end of the day, money is money. "Well, money always matters," said the matriarch. "I think that anybody would be foolish to say that money doesn't matter anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Khloé added that money was a huge influence in their decision to do the new series. "It definitely played a factor because we give so much of our personal lives up for entertainment," said the Good American founder. "We always have our private family conversations, and we're pretty brutal, me and my sisters, with what we will settle for or not settle for. But not all money is good money. It has to be a good fit, and Hulu was just the perfect fit for us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Walt Disney Television's chairman of entertainment, Dana Walden hinted that the offer was certainly not cheap. "We stepped up to a great deal that they very much deserve," she said. "Who would you want more for your unscripted slate than the Kardashians? They perfectly symbolize our strategy, which is taking big shots, but the right shots, and betting on incredible talent and best-in-class opportunities in each genre." We're sure Kris also negotiated a great deal for the family. According to Khloé, "she fights like a pit bull" when it comes to these things.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Rob Kardashian Make His Money In 2022?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-to-expect-from-hulu-39-s-39-the-kardashians-39>What To Expect From Hulu's 'The Kardashians'</h2><p>Executive producer Ben Winston said that they're maintaining the formula that made KUWTK a hit. "If it ain't broke, don’t fix it," he said. "It feels different, but yet, ultimately builds on the great show that they did." Kris also acknowledged that they are their own products in this business. "I realized really quickly that we had something, and it was very special," the momager said of their reality TV fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Once we knew it was a hit," she continued. "That's when you put on a more creative hat and you start to think, 'Oh, I see where this might be going. Maybe we should do something a little more outside the box and use this show as an amazing platform.' And that's what we did." And something to look forward to: Kim confirmed that she'll be discussing <a href=#>her romance with Pete Davidson</a> on season 1.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Did Kanye West Change His Face?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyaqZ5lpJ2ybrfAq5uaq5ierq95yZ6lp52iqHqurcqipaBllqe8rnnToZyiql2jsrh5x66jrmWjnby4ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
