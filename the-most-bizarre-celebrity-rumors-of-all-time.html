The speculation started after Beyoncé was seen sporting what some perceived to be a prosthetic baby bump during her performances. However, the singer and her husband Jay-Z publicly denied the rumors and chalked it up to the power of illusion and creative costuming. Additionally, several photos and videos were released to show the progression of Beyoncé's pregnancy, which seemed to dispel the notion that she was wearing a fake bump. Despite the lack of evidence, the rumors persisted for several years and sparked heated debates online.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Conspiracy Theorists: 8 Celebrities Who Often Believe In Conspiracy Theories</a></span></p><h2 id=stevie-wonder-isn-39-t-really-blind><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Stevie Wonder Isn't Really Blind</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People have believed that <a href=#>Stevie Wonder isn't actually blind</a> for a while now. The rumor is a longstanding conspiracy theory that has been circulating for several decades. Despite the fact that Wonder was born prematurely and as a result lost his sight, many people have claimed over the years that he feigned blindness as a way to enhance his musical career. Proponents of this theory often point to instances where they believe Wonder was caught peeking or had an unusually good sense of spatial awareness, as evidence of his supposed deception.</p><p>However, these claims have been debunked by those close to Wonder, including friends, family, and associates, who have all attested to his genuine blindness. Wonder himself has publicly addressed the rumors on numerous occasions, stating that he lost his sight as a result of a congenital condition and that he has never been able to see. Despite the lack of evidence supporting the claims, the rumors about Stevie Wonder's blindness persist to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=courtney-love-killed-kurt-cobain><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Courtney Love Killed Kurt Cobain</span></h2><p>The rumor that<a href=#> Courtney Love, the wife of late musician Kurt Cobain</a>, was involved in his death has been a subject of speculation and conspiracy theories for many years. The Nirvana frontman was found dead in his Seattle home in 1994, and the official cause of death was ruled as a suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. However, some people have disputed this conclusion and have pointed to various factors that they believe suggest foul play was involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some have pointed to inconsistencies in the official investigation and to the fact that Love had a history of drug use and instability, as reasons to believe Courtney Love may have been involved in Cobain's death. Despite these claims, there has been no credible evidence to support the notion that Love was involved in Kurt Cobain's death, and the official ruling of suicide remains unchanged. Nevertheless, the rumors and speculation surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain continue to be a topic of discussion to this day.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Stephen King Movie Conspiracy Theories Are Too Wild To Ignore</a></span></p><h2 id=katy-perry-is-jonbenet-ramsey><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Katy Perry Is JonBenet Ramsey</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rumor that <a href=#>Katy Perry is JonBenét Ramsey</a>, the child beauty pageant contestant who was murdered in 1996, is a conspiracy theory that has been circulating online for several years. Proponents of this theory claim that the pop singer is actually Ramsey, who was reported missing from her Colorado home on December 26, 1996, and found dead in the basement of the family's home a few hours later.

The theory suggests that Lohan, who starred in the 1998 film as both of the lead characters, had a twin sister who played one of the characters in the film and died during or after filming. This supposed twin sister was then replaced by Lohan for the remainder of the film. However, this theory is entirely untrue and has no basis in fact.</p><h2 id=nicolas-cage-is-a-vampire><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nicolas Cage Is A Vampire</span></h2><p>Okay, this one is actually hilarious. The rumors began in 2011 after an old photograph went up for sale on eBay. The sepia-toned photo from 1870 featured a portrait of a man who looked extremely similar to Nicolas Cage. The seller even listed the picture with the headline, "Nicolas Cage is a vampire." The actor later shut down speculation that he was a vampire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elvis-presley-is-still-alive><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Elvis Presley Is Still Alive</span></h2><p>The rumor that Elvis Presley, the legendary rock and roll singer, is still alive is a conspiracy theory that has been around since his death in 1977. Proponents of this theory claim that Elvis faked his own death and went into hiding, for reasons ranging from wanting to escape fame and fortune to fearing for his life. Despite the fact that he was officially pronounced dead after being found in his Memphis home on August 16, 1977, the theory has persisted for decades, fueled by a lack of concrete evidence surrounding his death and by various sightings of people claiming to be the singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-spielberg-directed-poltergiest><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Steven Spielberg Directed Poltergiest</span></h2><p>The rumor that Steven Spielberg directed Poltergeist, the 1982 supernatural horror film, has been discussed for several years. The film was actually directed by Tobe Hooper, who also directed The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with Spielberg serving as the producer. Despite this fact, the theory suggests that Spielberg really directed the film and that Hooper was given credit for publicity purposes only.</p><p>The rumor is based on the idea that Spielberg's distinctive style is present in the film and that the film's success is largely due to his involvement. However, this theory has been debunked by both Hooper and Spielberg, who have stated that Hooper was the sole director of Poltergeist. The film's crew and cast have also stated that Hooper was the director of the film and that Spielberg's involvement was limited to the role of producer.
