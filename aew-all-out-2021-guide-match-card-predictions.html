There's a very strong argument to be made that it's Double Or Nothing. It was the first PPV in AEW history and has featured some of the promotion's biggest matches since it debuted in 2019. However, there is also a very strong argument to be made for All Out. Even though DoN was AEW's first official PPV, All In, which would become All Out the following year, was really when it became clear that something special was happening and AEW was on the horizon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The third-ever All Out is almost here, and it could well be the biggest event in AEW history if the rumors and reports doing the rounds are to be believed. This year's All Out will take place on Sunday, September 5, 2021. It will be available to buy and watch on BR Live in the US, and Fite around the world. The show will begin at 8 pm EST with the Buy-In beginning 30 minutes before the start of the main card.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do AEW's Rumored Signings Create More Problems For The Women's Division?</a></span></p><h2 id=kenny-omega-vs-christian-cage-for-the-aew-championship>Kenny Omega vs. Christian Cage for the AEW Championship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/omega-v-cage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As soon as Christian Cage arrived in AEW, he made it clear he was gunning for the AEW Title. Just a few months later he already has his shot. An odd one, as despite this being a fairly big match, it feels a little lacking for a PPV main event. More like a match that would happen on TV, hence their first meeting taking place at Rampage.</p><p>In fact, Cage versus Omega will be Rampage's first-ever match, and the Impact Title will be on the line. The most likely scenario here is Cage beats Omega for the Impact Title and puts it on the line in what will be their rematch at All Out. That's where Omega will get his revenge, winning back the Impact Title in the process.</p><h2 id=cm-punk-vs-darby-allin>CM Punk vs. Darby Allin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/punk-vs-allin.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You don't need to pinch yourself. It really happened. <a href=#>CM Punk is back in wrestling</a> and has signed a deal with AEW. After filling everyone in on the last seven years, Punk cast his gaze over the rafters where Darby Allin and Sting were watching on. That's when The Second City Saint revealed his first opponent in AEW will be the former TNT Champion.</p><p><a href=#>Allin teased that he would be one of the first to cross paths with Punk</a> in AEW weeks ago. As for whether he will ruin Punk's triumphant return by beating him is something else entirely. This one is tricky to call. Allin winning and getting a real underdog upset could happen though, leading Punk to question whether he should have returned at all.</p><h2 id=britt-baker-vs-kris-statlander-for-the-aew-women-39-s-championship>Britt Baker vs. Kris Statlander for the AEW Women's Championship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/baker-v-statlander.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britt Baker is doing a terrific job of elevating AEW's women's division. She needs opponents though, and she may well have a worthy one in Kris Statlander at All Out. Statlander has been on an absolute tear since returning from injury, leading her all the way to Baker's door. A great example of AEW's rankings system actually working.</p><p>That tear comes to an end at All Out, though. Baker has been too important for her reign to end here. A new challenger will have made themselves known by the time this match happens via the Casino Battle Royale. More on that below.</p><h2 id=the-young-bucks-vs-the-lucha-bros-in-a-steel-cage-match-for-the-aew-tag-team-championships>The Young Bucks vs. The Lucha Bros in a Steel Cage Match for the AEW Tag Team Championships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/young-bucks-1.jpg><p>The Young Bucks have gotten pretty cocky since winning the titles and realigning with their old pal Kenny Omega. The hope is that this match will bring them down a peg or two. A steel cage match for the Tag Team Titles against the Lucha Bros, and one that could very well be the match of the night at All Out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Four teams competed in a tag team eliminator with the winning tandem getting the chance to step inside that steel cage with the Bucks. The Lucha Bros earned that opportunity, but Matt and Nick will likely leave the cage with their increasingly impressive title reign intact.</p><h2 id=chris-jericho-vs-mjf>Chris Jericho vs. MJF</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jericho-v-mjf-1.jpg><p>Chris Jericho recently wrestled through four brutal labors just so he could once again get his hands on MJF in the fifth. All of that just so he could lose yet again, this time with nothing else to blame but his own misgivings. Le Champion has become obsessed, and will face the young upstart one last time at All Out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This time, everything is on the line. By that we mean if Jericho loses, his in-ring career is over. This might seem bold, but with the amount of other stuff Jericho does coupled with his age, we're pegging MJF to win this one. The owner of the Dynamite Diamond Ring is already unbearable. Just imagine how much worse he will be when he can brag about retiring Jericho.</p><h2 id=miro-vs-eddie-kingston-for-the-tnt-championship>Miro vs. Eddie Kingston for the TNT Championship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/miro-v-kingston.jpg><p>After a rocky start to Miro's career during which his whole persona appeared to revolve around Kip Sabian and video games, the TNT Champion is very much on the track his fans envisioned for him in AEW. In fact, the Bulgarian is still yet to lose in singles competition. That streak, as well as his title, will be on the line against Eddie Kingston at All Out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for a winner, it's hard to look past Miro for this one. He is an incredibly hot commodity for AEW right now and having him lose the title could risk that. Kingston is great, but he very much feels like a bigger pin to knock down for Miro at All Out.</p><h2></h2><h2 id=women-39-s-casino-battle-royale-for-a-show-at-the-aew-women-39-s-championship>Women's Casino Battle Royale For A Show At The AEW Women's Championship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/casino-battle-royale-2.jpg><p>A mainstay of AEW PPVs are its battle royales. A sort-of hybrid of WWE's Royal Rumble. Wrestlers enter in four batches of five, plus a 21st person who enters last and alone, and you must be thrown over the top rope to be eliminated. All Out's Battle Royale will feature female wrestlers with the winner getting a shot at the Women's Title. 12 entrants for the match have been announced so far including Tay Conti and Nyla Rose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the winner, that's tricky to predict. Thunder Rosa earning another shot at Britt Baker would be a cool way to revisit what has been AEW's best female rivalry to date. However, with <a href=#>rumors that Ruby Riott is getting set to debut</a>, the former WWE Superstar entering at 21 and winning is also a possibility.</p><h2 id=paul-wight-vs-qt-marshall>Paul Wight vs. QT Marshall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/qt-marshall-paul-white-aew-dynamite.jpg><p>Paul Wight is yet to wrestle a match in AEW. In fact, he hasn't wrestled a match for more than a year at this point, competing in what would be his final bout for WWE in July of last year. That all changes at All Out. QT Marshall let his mouth run a little too much, and now <a href=#>he will have to answer to Wight on September 5</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Wight were facing a younger star who is being groomed to lead AEW in the future, then we'd have him pegged to lose this one. No offense to Marshall, but he doesn't fit that description. Wight to win this one and likely do better than most fans are expecting.</p><h2 id=jon-moxley-vs-satoshi-kojima>Jon Moxley vs. Satoshi Kojima</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/moxley-v-kojima.jpg><p>This match might not mean much to a lot of wrestling fans. If you're a fan of Japanese wrestling though, it's a very big deal. All Moxley ever wanted to do after he left WWE was live his best wrestling life, and this match is yet another example of that.</p><p>As for who wins, it really doesn't matter. This match is going to be terrific and further proof that the so-called forbidden door has been well and truly kicked open. Since it's taking place on one of AEW's biggest stages, we'll go with Mox for the win.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>SummerSlam To SummerSlam: What Went Wrong For Bray Wyatt And Braun Strowman?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeRmsRwrcSwZJqknGK8tsCMa2draV2irrWvx2aamqqUZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
