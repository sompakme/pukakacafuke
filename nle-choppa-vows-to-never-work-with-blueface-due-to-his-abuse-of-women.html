On Sunday (March 3), the Memphis rapper spoke with The Shade Room for an interview, during which he condemned physical abuse of women while citing a lack of respect for men who commit those crimes.
“One thing that I’ve grown to understand is treat women the best way you can treat ’em,” the 21-year-old told the outlet."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Never did any of those things.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So, when it comes to, would I do music with Blueface? Me, personally, I just wouldn’t do it because that’s the part I don’t respect. I don’t really respect people who just put their hands on women physically to assault them.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Cottonwood rapper also responded to Blueface’s claims that he backed out of participating in a proposed <a href=#>celebrity boxing match</a> between the two to settle their differences. According to NLE, the fight was never properly planned or scheduled, and that Blueface’s offer to fight him was a result of him attempting to protect his public image.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If I wanna fight and we wanna box, I’m gonna do it the right way,” Choppa said. “Like if we boxing I wanna make sure that we could get paper view sales I wanna make sure we can damn near do it in Vegas cause if we was to fight that’s a big moment.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1324471513.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued to question Blueface’s desire to face off against him in the ring, as he says Blueface’s manager, Wack 100, seemingly attempted to serve as a mediator to avoid the two artists clashing. “Wack 100 was calling my mother, my manager, saying like, ‘Ah, they need to chill it out,'” NLE claims.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So I’m like, ‘Is he getting a mediator in between to cut it off? Cause he smart. I didn’t know if he was trying to mediate the situation but also still try to take it there to make it look like I’m the one that’s backing out. But it was moreso like, what are we really doing?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1676869044.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The drama between NLE Choppa and Blueface began in 2023, but boiled over this past January, when the former collaborators became at odds due to Blueface dissing him on Jaidyn Alexis’ “Barbie (Remix).” In a social media post that’s since been deleted, NLE claimed that he felt that the two had settled their differences behind closed doors prior to the song’s release.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I hit you personally to stop speaking on me,” NLE wrote at the time. “I thought s*t was understood. Bet that.” Expressing his lack of concern for possibly angering NLE, Blueface offered him the opportunity to engage in a fist-fight, a challenge which NLE gladly accepted. “Let’s box @bluefacebleedem” he wrote on Jan. 4, one day after the “Barbie (Remix)” release. “Who can set up celebrity boxing match in Vegas me and him hit me ASAP. He undefeated vs women ion respect a nigga that put his hands on em anyway !”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See both artists’ social media posts below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Let’s box <a href=# rel=nofollow>@bluefacebleedem</a> ? who can set up celebrity boxing match in Vegas me and him hit me ASAP.
