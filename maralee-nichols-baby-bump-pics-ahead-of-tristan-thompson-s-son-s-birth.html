He told me he was <a href=#>single and coparenting</a>,” Nichols claimed in a statement nine months later. “I would never have gotten involved with Tristan if I thought he was in a relationship.”</p><p>The new mom went on to say in December 2021 that she allegedly “communicated daily” with the athlete, adding that she saw the Canada native “several times” every month.</p><p>“Despite the challenges that I know I would have as a single mother and Tristan’s reaction to my pregnancy, I told Tristan I would be having the baby,” Nichols told Us at the time. “I do not want any further media attention, nor do I want a romantic relationship with Tristan. My goal is to raise our son in a safe, healthy, loving and private environment.”</p><p>Court docs revealed that same month that the former personal trainer had <a href=#>sued Thompson for child support</a> in June 2021. The Sacramento Kings player <a href=#>confirmed his paternity</a> one month after <a href=#>Nichols gave birth</a>.</p><p>“Today, paternity test results reveal that I fathered a child with Maralee Nichols. I take full responsibility for my actions. Now that paternity has been established, I look forward to amicably raising our son,” the power forward wrote via Instagram Stories in January 2022 before going on to apologize to Kardashian.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Khloé, you don’t deserve this,” Thompson added. “You don’t deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you. You don’t deserve the way I have treated you over the years,” he shared. “My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you. I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.”</p><p>The former Cleveland Cavaliers player began dating the<a href=#> Keeping Up With the Kardashians </a>alum in 2016, and Thompson <a href=#>cheated on her two previous times</a> — once while the reality star was pregnant with their daughter in 2018 and again the following year with<a href=#><strong> Kylie Jenner</strong></a>‘s then-best friend<a href=#><strong> Jordyn Woods</strong></a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to revisit Nichols’ baby bump photos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuqK%2BwKWcnmWenrCpu8usZJuZkq56o8HMqWSpoZOoeqK0xJqbZqeWYsGztdKtmKdlpJ28rrzSqKWsZaOku7R5waKpraBf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
