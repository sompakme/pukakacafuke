Let Andy Cohen Explain</a></span></p><p>“Both times I did the show, right before we went live, Andy Cohen privately asked me in an office if I wanted to do blow,” Griffin said of Cohen, whom she had worked with for 10 years.</p><p>“I was hoping he was kidding, the second time I do the show, same thing. So once again we’re alone in an office and he’s like, ‘Wanna do some coke?’ And I’m thinking, ‘He’s serious!’ Trust me, he’s going to say he’s kidding and everything, no. He was asking me to do cocaine with him, that made me very uncomfortable.”</p><p>Cohen wasted no time to clear his name from the claims made against him when he later took to his Twitter page, stressing: "I am completely stunned by this story. It is 100% false and totally made up.”</p><p>Bravo then gave a statement, insisting that there was no truth to the story and that the network also wasn’t going to “credit it with any more attention.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Cohen’s Video Meeting With The RHOBH Cast Jabs At Mauricio’s Marijuana</a></span></p><p>Two years later, Griffin had plenty more to say about Cohen, who she recalled as being the worst boss she ever had to work with, adding that he “treated me like a dog” and calls all the shots behind the scenes at Bravo.</p><p>“The guy, he decides the entire slate at Bravo, and yet he gave himself a talk show that magically gets renewed every year. So, you know, I had a talk show at Bravo for two years that got canceled. And I thought, ‘Yeah it’s sort of competition for Andy,’ So, no, he has not been very kind.”</p><p>The TV rivals continued their long-running feud well into 2020 when Griffin shockingly claimed that Cohen allegedly told her to take Joan Rivers’ job at Fashion Police<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on the very same day that she died</a>, which she considered being extremely insensitive on his part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a series of tweets posted over the summer, the Life On The D-List star had quite a lot of things to get off her chest.</p><p>“When my beloved Joan Rivers passed away, I was devastated. I still miss Joan every day as I know you guys do. She wasn’t just a mentor, she was a true and giving friend to me.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Cohen’s Emotional Roller Coaster… He Added A Baby, But Lost A Dog</a></span></p><p>“That POS Andy Cohen texted me the day Joan died with something like ‘you should take over Fashion Police.’ My friend Joan was a person, not a job opportunity,” she shared.</p><p>Of course, Cohen wasn’t going to bite his tongue in this instance either as he wasted no time to respond, but according to him, Griffin’s story wasn’t all that accurate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I loved her too. I texted you the evening she died saying how brilliant you were on CNN, & what a unique club you were in w/ JR."</p><p>”The next day I texted saying you’d be great on FP. A few months prior texted you suggesting you take over 1230 on CBS. What awful texts! XO POS ANDY,” he cheekily responded, bringing light to the name-calling jab.</p><p>It doesn’t seem as if Griffin nor Cohen plans on ending their feud anytime soon, especially when they’ve been going back-and-forth with one another for four years.</p><p>Griffin seems hurt by the way she was treated over at Bravo and Cohen seems to be under the impression that his former colleague is acting irrationally because she held a lower position at Bravo.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Ellen Beloved or Overrated?
