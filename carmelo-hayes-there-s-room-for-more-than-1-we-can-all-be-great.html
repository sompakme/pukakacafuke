Also, his friend <a href=#>Trick Williams</a> was attacked by an unknown assailant. While Lexis King claims to be the mind behind Williams’ attacks, there is still speculation that Carmelo Hayes was the one who attacked his own friend.</p><p>Last week on WWE NXT, Trick Williams <a href=#>qualified for the Men’s Iron Survivor Challenge</a> that will be taking place at the Deadline Premium Live Event. As Williams was celebrating his win, Hayes seemed to look a tad bit jealous of his friend.</p><p><a href=#>Hayes</a> is still looking forward to getting an opportunity to take part in the Iron Survivor Challenge.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Hayes is highly speculated to be the one to have attacked his friend. The reason for this is quite obvious. Fans are convinced that the former NXT Champion wants to be the only one standing at the top of the mountain. Carmelo Hayes took to Twitter to seemingly shut those speculations down. He claimed that there’s more room at the top of the mountain and thus everyone can become great and big stars together.</p><p>“We can all be great. We can all be big stars. There’s room for more than just 1. Everybody chill ✊?,” Carmelo Hayes tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We can all be great. We can all be big stars.
