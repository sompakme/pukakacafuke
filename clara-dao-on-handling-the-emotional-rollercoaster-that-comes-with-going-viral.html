plus, now that she's better equipped to deal with the rollercoaster, Clara can truly enjoy the moment, rather than agonize over views and likes.</p><h2 id=clara-pinpoints-the-best-platform-for-virality>Clara Pinpoints The Best Platform For Virality</h2><p>While Clara stresses the importance of knowing what lies ahead when it comes to going viral, she's also passionate about seeing other content creators succeed, and if virality is the goal, she's happy to impart some pearls of wisdom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"TikTok offers the best chances of going viral,"</strong> she shares. <strong>"Content blows up there really fast."</strong></p><p>As for Instagram,<strong> "that takes a bit longer." </strong>However, at the end of the day, Clara concludes, <strong>"if you can think about what makes you special, that will resonate with someone, on any platform."</strong></p><p>Well, aspiring content creators, there you have it!
