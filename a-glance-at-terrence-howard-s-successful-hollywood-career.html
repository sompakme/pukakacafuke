His movie ensemble dates all the way back to 1993 with his minor role in the thriller buddy cop film, Who's The Man, starring <a href=#>rappers Dr. Dre </a>and Ed Lover, as well as cameos from a host of other rappers such as Ice-T, the female rap pioneer Queen Latifah, and Busta Rhymes.

To date, he has been in at least 50 movies, earning him a net worth of about $5 million. Let's take a closer look at the life and career of Terrence Howard.</p><h2 id=a-star-in-the-making>A Star In The Making</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 11, 1969, Terrence Howard wasn't as<a href=#> fortunate as many Hollywood actors</a> who were blessed with a decent upbringing. Firstly, Howard's mother, Anita, was just fifteen when he was born. He became a witness to a murder at only two years old when his father, Tyrone, stabbed and killed a man with a nail file, which tore apart the family and sent Tyrone to jail for eleven months on a manslaughter charge. Upon his release, he divorced from Anita, and Howard was split between Cleveland, where his father lived, and Los Angeles, where his mother stayed. But it was his great-grandmother, actress Minnie Gentry, who <a href=#>instilled a love of acting</a> in Howard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although he didn't complete his studies at Brooklyn's Pratt's Institute for chemical engineering, he launched into his acting career and was first introduced to the big screen on the ABC miniseries, The Jacksons: An American Dream, where he starred as Jackie Jackson alongside <a href=#>actress Angela Bassett</a> and Vanessa Williams. He would also go on to appear in other popular television shows like Family Matters, Living Single, and Picket Fences before landing his real film debut in 1995 in Mr. Holland's Opus, which starred</p><p>Richard Dreyfuss, Glenne Headly, and Jay Thomas. The film was a success and grossed $106 million on a $31 million budget. The same year, he appeared in the Hughes Brothers crime film, Dead Presidents,<a href=#> starring Larenz Tate</a>, comedian Chris Tucker, and Keith David, which grossed a little over $24 million domestically.
