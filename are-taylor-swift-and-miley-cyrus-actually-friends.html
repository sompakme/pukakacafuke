She also had a cameo in the movie. But did that time together on set cement a BFF-ship that would last more than a decade afterward? It's hard to tell.</p><h2 id=miley-and-taylor-shared-more-than-just-a-movie>Miley And Taylor Shared More Than Just A Movie</h2><p>While Taylor appeared (and performed) in Miley's 'Hannah Montana: The Movie,' the two also shared something else that neither party was probably happy about: each of them reportedly dated their co-star in the film (AKA Miley's on-screen love interest) Lucas Till.</p><p>Though <a href=#>Lucas wasn't the highest-profile of Taylor's previous beaus</a>, he was a highly connected former BF. But did Miley and Taylor have a falling out based on each of them dating a relative unknown for a month or so each? Likely not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Joe Alwyn Have The Lowest Net Worth Of All Taylor Swift's Boyfriends?</a></span></p><p>After they wrapped the film, Miley and Taylor even performed together at the Grammys. Both of them were in a vastly different place creatively, and they were more aligned at that point (and both singing more bubble-gum pop-country ballads), so it worked.</p><p>Yet Miley's drastic turn in 2013 drew criticism from all corners, and fans thought for sure Taylor would break from the friendship at that point. Surprisingly, Taylor was supportive.</p><h2 id=taylor-supported-miley-39-s-more-mature-creative-leanings>Taylor Supported Miley's More Mature Creative Leanings</h2><p>In response to Taylor's 2013 twerking episode, Taylor was supportive, reiterating that Miley was her own person and should be able to perform and dress how she wanted. It was nice of her, but Miley didn't exactly return the favor over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Billy Ray Cyrus Hated 'Hannah Montana'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sure, she posted a meme of her and Taylor for women's day one year... But it was an edited NSFW version of Miley's twerking with Robin Thicke, only with Taylor serving as the stand-in Robin...</p><p>That had Taylor's fans scratching their heads and wondering whether Miley was throwing some kind of shade. Taylor's lack of reaction to the tweet didn't help matters.</p><p>Plus, Miley's quotes about Taylor haven't always been positive; she referenced one of Taylor's music videos in an interview and alleged that its violence ('Bad Blood') was way worse than her nudity. Miley has even said she doesn't want to be "in the squad," likely <a href=#>referring to Swift's girl squad</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While neither half of this former BFF pair has explicitly said they're not friends, it seems very unlikely at this point that they'd be pals.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>8 Years Later: What Happened Between Miley Cyrus And Robin Thicke?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbq3NnWSmoZyaxm6v2KusrGWRmMG2rculsGaeop6yr7DSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
