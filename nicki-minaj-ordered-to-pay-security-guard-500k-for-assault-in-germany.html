Shortly after, the plaintiff says that Petty<a href=#> blindsided him</a> with a punch to the face, which shattered his jaw, leaving him “stunned and disoriented.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1205920657.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Weidenmuller detailed the ambush and the extent of his injuries in a court filing. “I felt a blinding pain in my head, neck, face and jaw. I could tell in that instant that something was seriously wrong with my jaw,” the plaintiff wrote.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I now have five plates in my jaw, and my jaw has not yet been fully reconstructed. The doctors must still insert implants into my jaw as a part of the reconstruction process. In the interim, the doctors have inserted donor bones from a deceased person into my mouth in order to preserve space for the future implants.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1097932874.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Weidenmuller was seeking $700,000 from Minaj and Petty for emotional pain and suffering, as well as $21,000 to cover his medical expenses, but was ultimately awarded $503,318.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The judgement was awarded after Minaj and Petty never responded to the lawsuit, despite several attempts to serve the couple, including trips to their home in Calabasas, Ca., and posting the summons for their court appearance in the newspaper.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6O2pLfIZqSippGfeqyxzaecraBdpbK1wNhmp5qxXWp9cbeMrJycraKewbp5xq6Yq5xdlsC0rdSlq2aflae6orrYZmhra2Rtg3SEkWlm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
