In some cases, Survivor's have later had dark chapters in their lives, including <a href=#>the first player to be medically evacuated</a> and <a href=#>the show's villain, Jeff Varner</a>.</p><p>From all accounts, Sunday Burquest was a lovely human being. Unfortunately for her and everyone who loved her, Burquest went through some tough times after Survivor because of the debilitating health issues she suffered.</p><p>This article will look at <strong>the terrifying-sounding medical emergency Sunday Burquest suffered after competing on Survivor</strong>. Then, the article will look at <strong>the tragic reason that Burquest passed away</strong> far too early in life.</p><h2 id=sunday-burquest-suffered-a-medical-ordeal-because-of-survivor>Sunday Burquest Suffered A Medical Ordeal Because Of Survivor</h2><p>For many fans, Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X is considered one of the best seasons ever. While there are several reasons for that, one of the biggest is the fact that Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X featured a stellar cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the season's best-remembered cast members include Adam Klein, Hannah Shapiro, David Wright, Michaela Bradshaw, Zeke Smith, Bret LaBelle, and Jay Starrett. While Sunday Burquest doesn't get talked about as much as those players, she was a great addition to the season's cast.</p><p>With that in mind, it is unfortunate to know what Burquest went through after she finished filming Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X. As a March 2019 Men's Health article revealed, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burquest went through a terrifying-sounding medical emergency</a></strong> after her Survivor experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-s-sunday-burquest-having-her-torch-snuffed-out.jpg><p>While talking to Men's Health, Burquest revealed <strong>what happened to her immediately after her season of Survivor finished filming</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who successful was Sunday Burquest during Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Placement:</p></td><td><p>13th Voted Out/7th Jury Member</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Votes Against Her:</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As Burquest revealed, she was preparing to return to America when something happened that she didn't think was a big deal at the time.</p><p>"The day after the game we were packed and ready to head back to the US. I remember getting bitten by a bug on my arm near my elbow but thought nothing of it, I had multiple bug bites throughout the game."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1-2024-06-17t012520-928.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Survivor's Dawn Meehan Was So Traumatized By The Show That She Had A 'Literal Breakdown' And Was Hospitalized">Survivor's Dawn Meehan Was So Traumatized By The Show That She Had A 'Literal Breakdown' And Was Hospitalized</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Survivor's Dawn Meehan was open about how suffering a "literal breakdown" and being hospitalized after playing the game the second time.</p><p>While Burquest didn't think the bug bite was a huge concern at first, it didn't take too long for her to realize there was an issue. In fact, according to what Burquest told Men's Health, she noticed that something was wrong with her by the time she made it to the airport.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Burquest flew home to America with her fellow tribemates. However, <strong>things had gone from bad to worse by the time she arrived home</strong>.</p><p>"While we waited to board our flight from FIJI to the USA, I noticed my arm was hot to the touch and all I thought to myself was, that’s weird. After a 12-hour flight we landed in LA where I’d wait another five hours for my flight home, by this time my arm is not only hot, it’s starting to swell. I landed in Minneapolis and the swelling had increased, going from my forearm to my triceps area."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-s-sunday-burquest-close-up.jpg><p>The day after Burquest arrived back in America, she went to the hospital to get her arm treated. At first, the doctors gave her some medication hoping her situation would swiftly improve.

Burquest took her final breath a little less than a year after she revealed that <strong>she'd been diagnosed with esophageal and ovarian cancer</strong>. Burquest was only 50 years old at the time of her passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/survivor-star-jaime-huffman-romance-with-husband-erik-huffman-comes_gr-1b.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Survivor Star Jaime Huffman's Romance With Husband Erik Huffman Comes To A Crashing End With Her Damning Allegations">Survivor Star Jaime Huffman's Romance With Husband Erik Huffman Comes To A Crashing End With Her Damning Allegations</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Survivor stars Jaime Huffman and Erik Huffman fell in love on the show but their marriage fell apart amid disturbing allegations.</p><p>Before Burquest passed away, she lived what appeared to be an incredible life. After all, Burquest was a youth pastor with a longtime husband, four children, and two daughters-in-law who went on the adventure of a lifetime.</p><p>On top of that, after Burquest was diagnosed with cancer, she spoke to People about her situation. While speaking to the outlet, <strong>Burquest described the incredible way she dealt with her cancer battle</strong>.</p><p>"Here's my thinking. No one knows how much time you have left. Accidents can happen. Miracles can happen. Someone healthy can die unexpectedly, and someone sick can live for much longer than expected. So I don't think of this as a death sentence; I think of this as something that has happened, and is now a part of my life.

For example, Zeke Smith wrote on X, “I will miss you always @sundaysurvivor you left an indelible legacy and will be my darling forever. Rest in Power.”</p><p>Some of her former tribemates who paid tribute to Burquest include David Wright, Will Wahl, Zeke Smith, Bret Labelle, Jessica Lewis, Jessica “Figgy” Figueroa, Hannah Shapiro. Survivors from other seasons also posted about how great Burquest was and so did Jeff Probst. Arguably <strong>the most touching tribute from a former Survivor came from the winner of Burquest's season, Adam Klein</strong> whose mom passed away after fighting cancer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“A couple of days ago, I texted Sunday to check in and send some love, that night, her daughter responded with a message from Sunday: ‘She is going to say hi to your mom for you.’ Sunday ALWAYS thought about others first.
