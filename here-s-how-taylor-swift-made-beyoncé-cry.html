In reality, however, the only reason why certain stars manage to wield a certain amount of power in the entertainment business is that they have consistently made money for everyone involved. Instead, if a performer is a part of a few failed projects in a row or one that performs especially badly, they will quickly be shown the door.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of the fact that entertainers are often judged entirely on their last failure or success, they are also played off of one another as well. After all, even if a pop star is still enjoying a great deal of success, they will quickly find themselves unkindly compared to the next big thing that comes along. Worse yet, it seems abundantly clear that the powers that be in the industry and media often push female entertainers to feud with one another.</p><p>Since Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have both enjoyed a huge amount of success in the same era, it seems safe to assume that there were a lot of forces pushing them to resent one another. With that in mind, it is fascinating to learn that it has been confirmed that <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong> once made <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> cry.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pink Almost Got Into A Fist-Fight With This Major Pop Star</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-incident-for-the-ages>An Incident For The Ages</h2><p>During the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, Taylor Swift had an amazing night. Tapped to play her hit song “You Belong With Me” during the show, Swift also took home one of the most important awards of the night when she won the Best Female Video category. Of course, as anyone who remembers the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards should be able to attest, Swift’s triumphs that night took the backseat to a major controversy.</p><p>At the end of the day, one of the biggest reasons why anyone watches an awards show is to see who wins and either celebrate their triumph or judge everyone involved for crowing the wrong person. As a result, when it was announced that Taylor Swift won the Best Female Video award at the 2009 MTV VMAs, it is very safe to assume that some people at home were outraged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, when a fan thinks that the wrong star took home an award, all they can do is express their opinion to anyone who is with them or shout into the empty chasm that is social media. Since Kanye West was at the 2009 MTV VMAs, he was able to take to the stage in the middle of Swift’s acceptance speech and he did just that. Once West completely hijacked Swift’s moment to proclaim that Beyoncé deserved to win instead, even the people who felt the same way quickly turned on Kanye.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Social Media Erupts With News That Doja Cat Will Host The MTV VMAs</a></span></p><h2 id=the-known-aftermath>The Known Aftermath</h2><p>In the days that followed the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the amount of anger that was directed at Kanye West is hard to overstate. For example, President Barack Obama even weighed on the incident when he called West a “jackass”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to the reactions that everyone who was uninvolved with the Kanye West and Taylor Swift 2009 MTV VMAs incident had, the two performers would go on to address what happened. For example, the night after the incident, West went on to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno to express his regret. "I'm just dealing with the fact that I hurt someone or took anything away from a talented artist or anyone, because I only wanted to help people...I immediately knew in this situation that it was wrong...It's someone's emotions that I stepped on. It was rude, period."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, almost a week after the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift went on The View and made it clear that West hadn’t expressed his regret to her directly. On top of that, Swift admitted that she felt “rattled” by the incident. With that in mind, it isn’t surprising in the slightest that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift and West have gone on to feud</a> with one another since then.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Taylor Swift Vs Kanye West Feud: Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=extremely-upset>Extremely Upset</h2><p>After Kanye West took to the MTV VMAs stage to throw water on Taylor Swift’s moment, most of the people in the press were talking about those two stars. However, there was another person involved, and judging by the look on Beyoncé’s face when she was caught on camera during the incredibly awkward moment, she felt terrible for Swift.</p><p>In 2012, the MTV Music Group President at the time, Van Toffler, talked to Entertainment Weekly about the wildest moments in MTV Video Music Awards history. Unsurprisingly, the topic of the Kanye West and Taylor Swift moment came up and Toffler revealed just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how upset by the situation Beyoncé was</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I walked back behind the stage to find Beyoncé crying about the incident. Ultimately I talked to her and her dad and then went back to Taylor after her performance, and an hour later Beyoncé brought Taylor back out so she could have her moment.” Given the fact that Beyoncé wasn’t to blame for what happened to Taylor Swift, it is sad that she was so upset by what happened. That said, it seems to have <a href=#>spawned a friendship between Beyoncé and Swift</a> that has lasted ever since so that is nice.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Beyoncé's Epic Birthday Video Features 21 A-List Celebrities</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmq5qxnKS%2Fbr%2FWop2tZZ2WsaZ5wZ6wqKaTmnqkvthmraaZXZbEor7DrGSkmZ6usm7DxKyraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
