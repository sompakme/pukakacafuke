While appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, <a href=#>Cameron revealed the sweet way Benji has bonded</a> with their toddler.</p><p>“He has, like, the best songs,” she said, explaining Benji and Raddix share a love for music. “They play in my head all the time because he sings them to her and she knows the words, and it’s the sweetest thing ever. It really is. It kills me.”</p><p>“He has some bangers,” Cameron continued. “I’m telling you. I’m like, ‘Whoa, that is like, that’s catchy.’”</p><p>Cameron has been sharing a bit more about her family since un-retiring from acting last year, but fans shouldn’t expect to get too many detail about her personal life, especially her daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cameron-diaz-made-a-fortune-from-unproven-allegations-and-scandals-while-dating-justin-timberlake.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cameron Diaz Made A Fortune From Unproven Allegations And Scandals While Dating Justin Timberlake">Cameron Diaz Made A Fortune From Unproven Allegations And Scandals While Dating Justin Timberlake</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>During Cameron Diaz's forgotten relationship with Justin Timberlake, she cashed in on a pair of scandals that she was the victim of.</p><p>When Raddix was born, Benji and Cameron issued a statement confirming her birth but that <a href=#>they wouldn’t be sharing a lot of information</a> or even photos about their child, saying they “feel a strong instinct to protect our little one's privacy."</p><p>Given that no images of Cameron pregnant were ever published, and the actress’s age at the time of her daughter’s arrival (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she would’ve been 47</a>), there’s been speculation Cameron and Benji use a surrogate to welcome Raddix.
