Errol Musk told The Sunday Times that he has a 10-month-old son named Elliot Rush with Jana Bezuidenhout, who was 4 years old when he married her mother, Heide Bezuidenhout. He and Heide were together for 18 years and have two children of their own. Errol, 72, said he did not see Jana, 30, as a stepdaughter because she was mostly raised away from the family."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He and Heide were together for 18 years and have two children of their own.

He called the baby boy an “exquisite child,” but said he does not live with Jana or Elliot.</p><p>“Jana is a delightful girl and a wonderful mother,” Errol added. “She said I had changed her life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elon-musk.jpg><p>An unnamed relative told the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, which was first to report the news: “The whole family was outraged when we found out. This is the reason why Elon is so angry with Errol. He is the only father [Jana] has ever known. And now he is the father of her child as well.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Errol also spoke with the paper, saying, “I told my daughter Ali about [Elliot] because I thought she would be supportive and understanding. She said I was insane, mentally ill. She told the others and they went berserk. They think I’m getting senile and should go into an old age home, not have a life full of fun and a tiny baby.”</p><p>Elon, 46, has spoken candidly in the past about his estrangement from his father. “He was such a terrible human being. You have no idea,” the billionaire entrepreneur told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> in November. “My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil. … Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaepJ%2Bjeq7B0qSqZp2jqb%2Biusaem2aekam1pr6Mm5ibsV2owaa8w5qsoKCkmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
