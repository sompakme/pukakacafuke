A successful season 2 could set this show up for even more acclaim.</p><p>Fans want to know everything about the show, including how much the cast is making. We have the details below!</p><h2 id=39-only-murders-in-the-building-39-was-a-major-success>'Only Murders In The Building' Was A Major Success</h2><p>2021's Only Murders in the Building was a show that had people interested long before it premiered. This was primarily thanks to the cast, which featured Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez. It was an interesting choice of major players, and it was a choice that paid off greatly for the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season one proved to be a massive critical success, and the fans were sucked into the show instantly.</p><p>There is a lot going on in the series, but the folks behind the scenes, notably series creator, John Hoffman, struck a perfect balance.</p><p>"We are really juggling a lot of balls with tone and with storylines—the comedy, the characters, the connection, the themes of connection, New York, all of it all at once. That was really the challenge, but it was also the thrill. It was the question whether people would embrace something that had a lot going on tonally," he told The AV Club.</p><p>During season one, Hulu was quick to approve a second season, and fans want to know all the details about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here Are The Salaries Of The Cast Of 'A Million Little Things'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=season-2-of-only-murders-in-the-building-should-raise-the-bar>Season 2 Of Only Murders In The Building Should Raise The Bar</h2><p>Season 2 of Only Murders in the Building is one that fans are ready for, and it will look to keep up the same momentum that season one generated.</p><p>When talking about the show's second season, series creator, John Hoffman said, "The way in which a true crime podcast or something like that can build a community … the show builds the same kind of community around its mystery and creates dialogues between us and can connect us,”</p><p>This is promising news for fans, as the show always knew when to dial up the satire while still staying grounded enough to function as a mystery.</p><p>Separately, Hoffman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about the lead characters</a> and the fallout of season one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They were all lonely people who are also complicated people with heartache and pain. I know that doesn’t sound like a great premise for a comedy, but I always like to find the human leveling qualities about people we can all relate to," he said.</p><p>It won't be easy, but the show will do its best to be just as good the second time around.</p><p>We may not know how things will fully look in season two, but we do know that the cast is making a pretty penny for being on the hit show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mary Cosby's Net Worth And 'Real Housewives' Salary, Revealed</a></span></p><h2 id=steve-martin-and-martin-short-both-earned-600-000-per-episode-of-only-murders-in-the-building>Steve Martin And Martin Short both earned $600,000 per episode Of Only Murders In The Building</h2><p>So, how much is the cast of the show making per episode? Unfortunately, exact data on all cast members is not known at this time, but we do know that Steve Martin and Martin Short are making a ton of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"According to a report by Variety, Selena’s co-stars Steve Martin and Martin Short both earned $600,000 per episode of Only Murders in the Building, a Hulu murder mystery series. While details about Selena’s salary were missing from the report, it’s probably safe to assume that she was also earning a salary within a similar range alongside the seasoned actors," writes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a>.</p><p>As the site notes, Selena Gomez is probably making an exceptional amount of money, as well. She has a long history of success in entertainment, and truth be told, she is a much bigger name with younger audiences than Steve Martin and Martin Short are at this point. Yes, they've been around longer, but younger people will be more inclined to know who Selena Gomez is.</p><p>As things progress, actor salaries could change drastically. There are some cases of actors making over $1 million per episode, but this is pretty rare. Nevertheless, the possibility is still on the table.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'The Voice' Judges, Ranked By Salary</a></span></p><p>Only Murders in the Building has a lot of hype for its second season, so here's hoping the show is able to be as good the second time around.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's Are The Salaries Of The Cast Of Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimp6SpYrq2vsOeqaxlmaN6tbTEZpmuoZyZtq%2BzjJyYrKxdqK6trdGyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
