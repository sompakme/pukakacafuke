And that’s something you cannot explain. Like, there’s a feeling you get from her when you watch her in the ring, and that, that’s the that “it” factor, right? That’s like, Wow! Like, you know you get little butterflies like in your heart for what she does. Right? And then the second thing is, you know, I always can see the difference between somebody that’s really in it, and not in it with their in between movements. So people do a big move, they do a move, they do a move, all those in-betweens, like in between the moves, where are they? What are they doing? Are they really there? So it’s believable when you see like, like as a piece of art…she’s a feeler. She’s really there, she’s really being.”</p><p><a href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D25ioa_QrJ_M&source=gmail&ust=1468679955409000&usg=AFQjCNGfu1bFZHAMWZgVLzvu6JzOxJ0waA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25ioa_QrJ_M</a></p><p>“Everything comes down to passion I think that that wins, and she is probably the most passionate when I picture, as far as being in the ring and physically going.”</p><p><a href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYgAd6OenIsg%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&source=gmail&ust=1468679955409000&usg=AFQjCNHo9TejkgR5ZeNPiuBKUc_xDO3OsQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgAd6OenIsg&feature=youtu.be</a></p><p>“She is someone that will put you in your place.
