Everyone suffers from chapped lips at some point in their lives — even your favorite celebrities. Luckily, there are ways to prevent dry, cracked lips as the winter approaches. Emily Blunt‘s makeup artist, Jen Streicher, recently shared how she keeps the actress’ pout feeling soft and smooth year round — and it surprisingly doesn’t involve rich lip balms or nourishing night masks."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Luckily, there are ways to prevent dry, cracked lips as the winter approaches. <strong>Emily Blunt</strong>‘s makeup artist, <strong>Jen Streicher</strong>, recently shared how she keeps the actress’ pout feeling soft and smooth year round — and it surprisingly doesn’t involve rich lip balms or nourishing night masks. Instead, it’s all about exfoliation.</p><p>“I love using a good lip exfoliant. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lanolips Lemonaid Scrubba Balm</a> is great,” Streicher revealed to <a href=# rel=noopener>Byrdie</a> last year.&nbsp;Exfoliation is essential for buffing away dead skin cells and built-up product to unveil a smooth, soft canvas. While makeup artists and dermatologists often talk about the importance of exfoliating skin, lips are often left out of the equation — but lips are skin too, and they also greatly benefit from regular exfoliation, especially in the winter months when they’re more prone to drying out.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lanolips Lemonaid Scrubba Balm</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17</a> at Amazon!

Plus, with these types of scrubs, you need to follow up with a balm to fully seal in moisture. Streicher loves the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LanoLips Scrubba Balm</a> due to the fact that it’s essentially a one-and-done hybrid with an easy-to-use design. Half-balm and half-exfoliator, it comes in a handy stick which allows for a mess-free swipe on application. Superfine sugar crystals and crushed orange peel are scattered throughout the hydrating stick, so it gently buffs off flakes the moment it’s applied.</p><p>Once you feel like your mouth is adequately exfoliated, you can lick or pat the particles off. (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">It tastes like lemonade</a> — hello, sweet treat!) As a bonus, you don’t need to follow up with another product either, because lips are already coated in the restorative lanolin-rich moisturizer!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lanolips Lemonaid Scrubba Balm</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17</a> at Amazon!

I tried every lip moisturizer I could find to reduce the flaky skin on my lips —nothing worked successfully until Lanolips Lemonaid. You must try it for yourself!”</p><p>If your goal is to banish dry, flakey lips once and for all, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this scrub-balm is definitely a must-have</a> in your winter makeup bag — trust Us (and Emily Blunt’s makeup artist)!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lanolips Lemonaid Scrubba Balm</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17</a> at Amazon!
