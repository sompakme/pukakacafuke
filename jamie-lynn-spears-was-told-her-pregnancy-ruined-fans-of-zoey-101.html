Her decision to have a baby while working on a teen show ultimately sparked a public outcry.</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“[People were] having the conversation of young girls my age were having sex. And I think people didn’t want that … Of like, this is going on, but a lot of them aren’t getting pregnant” she explained, adding, “If I would’ve had an abortion, no one would have known about it, but it wouldn’t have changed the fact that I had sex.<a href=#> So I think that was really the bigger conversation</a>, like, ‘Now, young girls are going to want to have sex, or they are.'”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Spears led the show, which followed her character as she settles in at her new boarding school in Malibu, for four seasons before the network ultimately pulled the plug in 2008. The actress gave birth to her daughter, Maddie, whom she shares with ex <strong>Casey Aldridge</strong>, later that year. (Spears also shares daughter Ivey, 5, with husband <a href=#><strong>Jamie Watson</strong></a>, whom she married in 2014.)</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While Spears told <a href=#>Nylon</a> magazine in October 2020 that she “didn’t become pregnant until probably six months” after Zoey 101 wrapped — and that the show had simply run its course — she noted on Wednesday’s podcast episode that she was “shamed as a woman for making a choice.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“No one said one good thing,” she recalled. “It was just like, ‘You are the worst, you’ve ruined everything, every child now, wow, what a let-down you are.’ And so I just think that like, I would hope that we would do better.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Spears added that she hopes things would be different today — and that her experience returning for her new film,<a href=#> Zoey 102</a>, which premiered on Paramount+ Thursday, July 27, was a “full-circle” moment.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“When my daughter [Maddie, now 15,] came on set of [Zoey 102], she was like, ‘Wow, Mom, I can’t believe all of these people are here because of your show, and you did that, <a href=#>I’m so proud of you</a>,'” Spears shared. “And I swear to you that was like the moment that I said, ‘Thank you, God. Thank you so much, that moment makes it all worth it.'”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2esm642KelZqugmq6zv4ywmKxlpKS5pXnHnqlmqKKatK%2BtzZywZqqlnrumsIyfmKerXaSzbsbOnrBmaWBmfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
