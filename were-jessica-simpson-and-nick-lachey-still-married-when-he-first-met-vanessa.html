She was a host on the show, and he was a regular guest along with <a href=#>his band 98 Degrees</a>. Back then, <a href=#>Nick was still married to Jessica Simpson</a>. In 2006, Vanessa starred in Nick's video for What's Left of Me. In April that year, five months after <a href=#>his highly publicized divorce with Jessica</a>, Nick was seen flirting with Vanessa in an episode of MTV's Making the Video.</p><p>"How do we rehearse? Do we go to your trailer?" Vanessa joked, to which the heartthrob answered: "I think we just kinda have to do what they call 'improv.' Wing it. I don't think there's rehearsal time." She also admitted on camera, "He's a gem — mini-crush."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two started dating around that time. The following year, the MTV VJ announced her exit from TRL shortly after moving in with Nick. But in June 2009, a source confirmed to Us Magazine that the couple had split. It was "amicable," they said, adding that "they walk away from it still friends."</p><p>Two months later, the two were spotted kissing at a bar in Los Angeles. "We're trying to figure things out," Nick told Us at that time. "I don't pretend to know what the future holds, but everything's good. Vanessa's a good girl, and I care about her a lot." He also told Good Day Philadelphia that he was "happy in a relationship," and that he "was single for a minute there, and then we've kind of patched things up."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Viewers Had This Issue From Episode 1 Of 'The Ultimatum: Marry Or Move On'</a></span></p><h2 id=the-ultimatum-vanessa-lachey-gave-nick-lachey-before-marriage>The Ultimatum Vanessa Lachey Gave Nick Lachey Before Marriage</h2><p>In the first episode of The Ultimatum, Vanessa revealed that she had given Nick an ultimatum before they got married in 2011, hence their brief split in 2009.</p><p>"I always said I was going to be that girl that would never give a man an ultimatum," she shared. "We dated for five years. So I finally said, 'What are we doing?' I have now moved in with him, I renovated his entire bachelor pad, there was a bar in the pool. I'm like, 'Whatever you want!' Now I'm like, 'Okay, well, I want to put kids in the pool.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The NCIS Hawaii star</a> also recalled that seeing other people during their breakup gave them a better "perspective" on their relationship.</p><p>"We both saw one other person and we realized that if we got out of our own way, we could be amazing together," Vanessa recounted. "But it took seeing somebody else and me realizing I don't mind the things that I thought bugged me or were holding me back. I don't mind all that. Like, the bigger picture is how I feel about this person and their values of wanting to be with me and knowing everything about me."</p><p>Nick added, "I think we got perspective."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Raven Ross Joined Netflix’s Love Is Blind</a></span></p><h2 id=how-many-kids-do-nick-amp-vanessa-lachey-have>How Many Kids Do Nick & Vanessa Lachey Have?</h2><p>In March 2012, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child.

He came into this world at 8lbs 9oz and 21 inches. Love has truly been redefined for both of us."</p><p>In July 2014, the Lacheys announced that baby no. 2, a girl, was on the way. "Can't think of a better way to celebrate 3 years of marriage to my beautiful @VanessaLachey than this! #family," Nick wrote alongside a photo with the words, "It's a girl!" written on the sand at the beach.

When asked how they raise all three kids together, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa told People Magazine</a> that it's "a lot of teamwork," and that they still "carve out time" for themselves, so "there's no spontaneous date nights.
