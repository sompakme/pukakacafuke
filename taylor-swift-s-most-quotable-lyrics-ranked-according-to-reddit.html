Since she first started writing music as a young teenager, Swift has been an icon in the music industry. She made the transition from the country genre to the pop genre with her release of the album Red, and since then she has only increased in popularity. Currently, Swift is busy re-recording all of her own music in order to properly own the tracks after <a href=#>being essentially taken from underneath her by Scooter Braun</a>.</p><p>Not including the albums she has re-released, Swift has released a whopping ten albums since 2006. Her music showcases her wide range of skills with songwriting and has covered many different musical genres. Swift set out on The Eras Tour in 2023, during which she performed music from all of her albums, totaling over 40 songs and four hours of music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-taylor-swift-is-adding-to-her-current-740-million-net-worth-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Taylor Swift Is Adding To Her Current $1.1 Billion Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift is a cultural icon and a financial powerhouse in the entertainment industry, who is now in the billionaires club.</span><p>As a result of her tour, Swift's older songs are becoming popular again, and Reddit users have ranked her most quotable lyrics.</p><p><strong>Updated October 2023: </strong>Taylor Swift has been working hard on reclaiming albums that were sold out from underneath her and are now owned by Scooter Braun.
