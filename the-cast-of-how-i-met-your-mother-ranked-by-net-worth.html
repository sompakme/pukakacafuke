For nine years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How I Met Your Mother</a> featured a cast of characters going through their lives intertwining in New York City as the main character Ted narrates the story of how he met the mother of his two kids. The show has been acclaimed for having stellar writing, phenomenal acting, and having many storylines to keep the show fresh and unique. By having a studded cast performing as their characters, most of them will always be known for their work on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How I Met Your Mother: Details And Easter Eggs You Never Knew</a></span></p><p>Due to the show's success, the net worth for each main cast member (plus some occurring and guest stars) is remarkable. Whether before, during, or after the show's premiere and the finale, the actors here have been a part of many projects that keeps them in the seven digits. Here is the cast of How I Met Your Mother ranked by their net worth.</p><h2 id=cristin-milioti---4-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Cristin Milioti - $4 Million</span></h2><p>Fans of the show waited anxiously to figure out who would be the mother of Ted's children. The character Tracy McConnell made an appearance in the show first as an unseen character, but once the&nbsp;eighth season aired its season finale, she would be portrayed by Cristin Milioti. While Robin and Ted fell in love at first sight, their relationship became filled with romantic tensions and it didn't help that the creators Carter Bays and&nbsp;Craig Thomas confirmed that she would not be the mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cristin would join the main cast in the final season. Before appearing on the show, she appeared in others like 30 Rock and The Sopranos. Even if her $4 million net worth is not much compared to her costars, she still continues acting, appearing in the critically acclaimed film Palm Springs.</p><h2 id=wayne-brady---10-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Wayne Brady - $10 Million</span></h2><p>You may know him as a game show host from Don't Forget the Lyrics!&nbsp;and the 2009 revival of Let's Make a Deal or as a regular in the hilarious improv comedy Whose Line is it Anyway?, but the amazingly talented Wayne Brady is one of the recurring characters portraying James Stinson. It seemed like a coincidence when Wayne plays the half-brother of Barney, as both he and Neil Patrick Harris are comedians also.</p><p>Currently, Wayne has a $10 million net worth, continuing his work on television by being a regular in the Whose Line revival and will be appearing in&nbsp;Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe as Stapler Fist. As long as he can provide his rich singing voice and make Whose Line fans laugh, Wayne's career will remain fortunate and stable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-manganiello---16-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Joe Manganiello - $16 Million</span></h2><p>Even if he only appeared in seven episodes total,&nbsp;Joe Manganiello is one of the notable guest stars in How I Met Your Mother, playing Marshall's friend from law school, Brad Morris. Joe's career started off with a lot of anticipation due to his role as Flash Thompson from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Raimi's</a>Spider-Man trilogy. He's also had a lot of credits to his name on television, including the CBS sitcom.</p><p>As of 2020, Joe's net worth is $16 million. He has so many exciting projects coming up in this decade, reprising his role as Deathstroke/Slade Wilson in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zack Snyder's Justice League</a>, a director's cut of the 2017 film. He is also in the Magic Mike movies as Richie, a fellow dancer, and known for a more risque name.&nbsp;That's not all, as he has two other films currently in the works called Archenemy and Shoplifters of the World.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cobie-smulders---18-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Cobie Smulders - $18 Million</span></h2><p>Before How I Met Your Mother, Cobie Smulders was just an actress in lesser-known films and minor roles from TV shows including Smallville. When she auditioned for the show when Jennifer Love Hewitt of all people turned down the role, the show's creators were thankful for Cobie to come in to eventually become Robin&nbsp;Scherbatsky Jr. Thanks to the comedy series, she landed many other opportunities for both movies and television.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Celebrities We Totally Forgot Were In How I Met Your Mother</a></span></p><p>Along with How I Met Your Mother and roles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Maria Hill and Stumptown.

Being on the show has brought him to an amazing career path. Josh is not just tied to acting. He has debuted as a director for the 2010 film&nbsp;Happythankyoumoreplease, earning him a Sundance Film Festival award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has a net worth of $30 million and including the acting and directing, he is also into the theater.

The show is greenlit for a second season, so he will remain busy.</p><h2 id=alyson-hannigan---40-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alyson Hannigan - $40 Million</span></h2><p>Alyson Hannigan portrays Lily Aldrin,&nbsp;Marshall's wife as they got engaged in the pilot episode and had their ups and downs, but worked thing outs and got married in the second season's finale. Lily is talented at what she does but is rather controlling to where she is rather unpredictable. She's definitely had her high and low moments, but Alyson's portrayal is nonetheless fantastic.</p><p>Being on How I Met Your Mother doesn't end there, thanks to her incredible net worth of $40 million. Before the show debuted, she gained fame from the American Pie film series for her role as&nbsp;Michelle Flaherty, a character she's played for 13 years. This year, she has a few roles coming away to her resume, appearing in a movie based on a children's book titled&nbsp;Flora & Ulysses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=martin-short---40-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Martin Short&nbsp;- $40 Million</span></h2><p>To add more comedic talents to How I Met Your Mother, who else would be perfect other than the legendary Martin Short? As one of the greatest comedians in recent history, his appearance in the CBS show was certainly a surprise, but a good one at that. As Marshall's boss Garrison Cootes, his comedic timing was nothing short of brilliant, even if he only appeared in three episodes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Jaw-Dropping Things You Never Realized About ‘How I Met Your Mother’</a></span></p><p>He is tied with Alyson for a 2020 net worth of $40 million, and thanks to his previous works as an actor and comedian, he built that with his great career in the span of almost 50 years.
