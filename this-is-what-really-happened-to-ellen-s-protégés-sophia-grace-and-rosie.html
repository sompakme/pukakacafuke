After Sophia Grace and Rosie met Nicki Minaj and performed with her live on Ellen (<a href=#>which has now been cancelled</a>), DeGeneres brought them in to appear on her show in a more frequent capacity. The two conducted red carpet interviews with the biggest names at the biggest events in the industry, from the Grammys to the Billboard Music Awards. They also filmed segments where they met stars like Rihanna and Justin Bieber, even having a tea party with the latter!</p><p>Tea parties soon became the girls’ signature event and they were even given their own segment on the show: Tea Time With Sophia Grace and Rosie, during which they socialized with the likes of Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus.</p><p>According to J-14, the duo then appeared in two episodes of Sam & Cat and released their own single together.</p><h2 id=starring-roles-in-their-own-movie>Starring Roles In Their Own Movie</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Naturally, following their segment on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and newfound fame, came the movie; in 2014, the duo starred in Sophia Grace and Rosie’s Royal Adventure! The film followed Sophia Grace and Rosie playing themselves as two correspondents sent by Ellen to the land of Switzelvania to cover the coronation of a new queen.</p><p>While critics weren’t overly impressed with the movie, it was a testament to how much audiences and social media couldn’t get enough of this duo!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Believe That This Is The Interview That Started Ellen's Downfall</a></span></p><h2 id=going-their-own-ways>Going Their Own Ways</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they had a lot of success as a duo and had a huge global reach, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophia Grace and Rosie eventually went their separate ways</a>. In an interview with Australia’s The Kyle and Jackie O Show, Rosie admitted that the two had parted company, at least in an official capacity.</p><p>“Me and Sophia, we're cousins, and Sophia's gone her own way and I've gone my own way," she said (via Mamma Mia). But the young star confirmed that the two were not feuding and hadn’t fallen out. "We haven't fallen out. We're like best friends, I see her all the time because she is my cousin. I see her on special occasions like birthdays."</p><h2 id=sophia-grace-rsquo-s-business-ventures>Sophia Grace’s Business Ventures</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While their duo is no more, Sophia Grace and Rosie still have a lot going on in terms of their careers. Since going their own ways, Sophia Grace has released several solo songs in which she sings and raps, just like we saw her doing in her very first Nicki Minaj rendition.</p><p>In addition to her singing career, Sophia Grace has more than three million subscribers to her YouTube channel. She typically uploads beauty, lifestyle, and singing content for her fans. She also has another business venture: her own clothing brand called LoLoLondon, which she founded in 2020.

Although Sophia Grace did most of the singing when the duo performed together, Rosie has recorded and released a bunch of her own songs and music videos. One of her most popular singles was ‘Girls’, which was released in 2020 when Rosie was 14.</p><p>In an interview with E! News, Rosie said that her friends were the inspiration behind the song. “I’m still only 14 and I’m not focusing on boys just yet,” she said (via J-14). “To me, my friends are way more important right now! I’m just enjoying being a teenager with all my girls!”</p><p>Rosie also has her sights set on moving to Los Angeles full time to continue to pursue her career in the entertainment industry. “I spent so much time growing up there and I always told myself that one day I’d live there full time. There’s no place like Hollywood!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-reunion>A Reunion?</h2><p>Though Sophia Grace and Rosie are thriving on their own, a reunion may be in the cards one day.
