There is probably one dating experience that we will remember forever because it was so awful. Celebrities are no different than us when it comes to dating disasters. You would think that they would be able to avoid dating pitfalls because they are beautiful and amazing but unfortunately dating disasters are something that we can all relate to. It doesn’t matter if you are rich or poor we have all had to go on an awkward first date that ended in disaster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes, because they are celebrities, their stories are a little more dramatic and scandalous then ours are. Some of these stories are sad and will make you feel bad for your favorite celebrity while some of the stories are just downright crazy. When you read these stories, you will start to wonder if it’s just easier being single. These are the kinds of stories that stick with you so that when you go on your next blind date, you may shudder as you go out the door.</p><p>At least we can all breathe a sigh of relief when we realize that it’s not just us that has to experience these disastrous dates. You might even be able to learn from their stories and avoid situations like it yourself. Check out these terrible dating stories these 20 celebs wish they could forget.</p><h2 id=christina-milian-dealt-with-bad-breath><strong>Christina Milian Dealt With Bad Breath</strong></h2><p>By the sounds of Christina Milian’s date, his breath was so bad that it was overpowering. That can really make for an awkward date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I dated a guy who had really bad breath. Really bad. The elevator, the car, everything smelled like his breath. Even gum didn’t help!”</strong></p><p>Maybe he should have scrubbed his teeth really good before he picked his date up. Milian had stated before that she doesn’t like it when people don’t take care of themselves so she would have found this to be extra offensive. We doubt there was a second date after this one, once you realize someone didn’t put effort into giving off a great first impression, you unlikely to give them another chance. We have to wonder if she let him know considering there was gum involved.</p><h2 id=kelly-rowland-fell-asleep><strong>Kelly Rowland&nbsp;Fell Asleep</strong></h2><p>The last thing that you want is to have your date bored out of her mind because it’s unlikely to get you a second one. When Kelly Rowland went to the movies with her date, she fell asleep on his shoulder and even snored. Not exactly what you are looking for on a date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I fell asleep on his shoulder, and I slobbered and snored. That was pretty bad. But he shouldn’t have taken me to see There’s Something About Mary for my third time.”</strong></p><p>Maybe he didn’t know that she had seen it twice already or maybe he just really liked the movie. She was just as guilty of the bad date as he was and there probably wasn’t another date after. A girl wants to be excited about her date not falling asleep.</p><h2 id=when-britney-s-date-wasn-t-that-into-her><strong>When Britney’s Date Wasn’t That Into Her</strong></h2><p>Britney Spears was on a date with a guy that she really liked, but she could tell that he wasn’t that into her. It may have had to do with her increasing anxiety however because people can sense when we are on edge. Sometimes it’s best just to chill out. “I had a really bad date. I mean, it was really bad,” Spears said.</p><p><strong>“I’ve been single for ages and had a date with a guy I liked. I was getting anxious, worrying he wouldn’t like me.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the evening, I got on the scales, and I had lost 6 lbs. We went to the movies, but I could tell right away it wasn’t working. It was sort of awkward. So after the movie, I came home, and that was it,” she said, adding, “He just wasn’t that into me. I liked him. He knew that. But he definitely didn’t feel the same. It happens to everybody. Being famous doesn’t make you any different.”</p><h2 id=lauren-conrad-let-her-mom-set-her-up><strong>Lauren Conrad Let Her Mom Set Her Up</strong></h2><p>That’s usually a bad sign. The guy your mom wants you to be with is not usually the one you choose to be with.</p><p><strong>"I've been on a lot more bad first dates than good ones — there's been so many. For one, my mother set me up, which should have been a red flag. He and I didn't talk for the majority of the date&nbsp;— we just sat there in awkward silence. I ate as quickly as I could to speed up getting out of there."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That sounds terrible and the worst thing that can happen on a first date is for the sparks to be dead and dying on the table. It just goes to show that sometimes the rich and the famous go through the same things that we do. We love that she hurried through her meal so that she could get out of there.</p><h2 id=vanessa-bayer-really-embarrassed-herself><b>Vanessa Bayer Really </b><b>Embarrassed</b><b>&nbsp;Herself&nbsp;</b></h2><p>There may have been a reason why she was in the Trainwreck movie, she kind of sounds like one in real life. She went to a college formal with a guy and to say that it ended horribly would be the understatement of the year. “There was a formal I went to in college where I matched this huge guy drink for drink, and then I ended up throwing up on myself, but not really knowing about it and being like, ‘We should hang out more,'” Bayer said. “And he was like, ‘I’m going to go home.’ And then I woke up a few hours later and realized that I had thrown up all over my dress. [I was like], ‘Oh, that wasn’t the coolest look.'” No wonder he decided to get out of there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-went-to-the-bathroom-and-never-came-back><strong>Kelly Clarkson Went to The Bathroom And Never Came Back</strong></h2><p>Sometimes you have to do something drastic to get out of an awful first date. It definitely takes some bravery to walk out on your date, but sometimes desperate measures have to be taken. “He proceeded to talk about his height for a solid hour. I withstood an hour. Then I went to the bathroom and I left,” she said. “I’m going straight to hell, I’m aware. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever done. He was just sitting there, at a Bennigan’s. It was bad, Y'all.” Her hilarious story is one that we have all felt at one point. We would suggest not sitting there and listening to his ramble for an hour, just end the date and say it’s just not working for you. Or get up and go to the bathroom, and then just leave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=petra-nemcova-had-to-listen-to-him-talk-about-himself-all-night><strong>Petra Nemcova Had To Listen To Him Talk About Himself All Night</strong></h2><p>Oh, we have all definitely been there. When a guy sits there and lists all the great things about himself, you know you are dating a narcissist. The model told Glamour about her painful experience. “I think the worst date is probably if the guy is just — and it did happen — talking about himself and how great he is! That's just a great date,” Nemcova joked. “I just listened and nodded and smiled, but I left when I had to go. I always try to find the good in anyone, but [talking about yourself all the time] is not very attractive.” We wouldn’t think so and it just goes to show that he wasn’t even willing to learn new things about his date. Instead, he just listened off all his great attributes.</p><h2 id=kelly-osbourne-didn-t-want-to-be-kissed><strong>Kelly Osbourne Didn’t Want To Be Kissed</strong></h2><p>The end-of-the-night kiss is always nerve-wrecking whether you want to be kissed or not. It all depends if it’s been a comfortable date and whether there were sparks. Sometimes, we want a kiss from our date and other times we’re not feeling it. Kelly Osbourne tried so hard to avoid a kiss from her date that she ended up breaking her wrist. “He went to kiss me and I got scared because I was still very much a prude,” the star told PEOPLE of her very first date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I leaned back and fell down three stairs onto the street, broke my wrist, and ran away from him.”</strong></p><p>We have a hard time picturing her as a prude, she’s always so “out there,” but it does make for a funny story. Poor girl.</p><h2 id=nikki-reed-got-rejected-in-grade-two><strong>Nikki Reed Got&nbsp;Rejected In Grade Two&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It’s good to hear that she hasn’t had a worst date than the one she experienced in grade two. The problem with dating boys in grade school is that they haven’t learned yet how to let us down easy and Nikki Reed got burned badly. She told Glamour, “When I was in second grade, I went on a date with this guy. I thought it was a date, but he didn’t,” said Reed.</p><p><strong>“And I wrote on a piece of paper, ‘Do you want to be my friend or my boyfriend or nothing? Circle one.’ And he circled ‘nothing.’ That was probably my worst date ever!”</strong></p><p>That’s so mean! Well, at least she can console herself on the shoulder of one of the most handsome vampires in existence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-had-to-pick-up-her-date><strong>Kim Kardashian Had To Pick Up Her Date</strong></h2><p>Guys if you are trying to date a girl that is already a reality TV star and has millions of dollars you better hope you have a car to pick her up in, otherwise it’s unlikely you’re getting a second date. She claimed,</p><p><strong>“I picked him up from the car wash and then we ate Chipotle.”</strong></p><p>As good as Chipotle is we doubt that’s where Kim Kardashian wanted to go for dinner especially since she already had to pick the guy up at a car wash.&nbsp; She looks super unimpressed in this photo and we think he probably got that vibe from her. At least she wasn’t rude about it, but we doubt he got a callback. Judging by interview where the story was brought up, Kim didn’t find the date the least bit funny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tori-spelling-was-a-mess><strong>Tori Spelling Was A Mess</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, when a girl realizes that her date has gone down the toilet, she says to hell with it and hits the bar. It can be the only way to get through a date that is just boring you to tears. That’s what happened to Tori Spelling. “Four drinks and two hours of a one-way conversation later, I was way too bored and a mess. I was feeling sick. Actually, the room started spinning at this point, as he went on and on about how David Charvet robbed him blind from what would have been his breakout role on Baywatch.” We feel bad for any woman that has to go through a date like this because we probably all know what it feels like. Making yourself sick over it just isn’t worth it.</p><h2 id=eliza-doolittle-will-never-go-on-a-blind-date-again><strong>Eliza Doolittle Will Never Go On A Blind Date Again</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, it’s just not meant to be and blind dates can be the worst dates of all. Eliza Doolittle already felt awkward on the date, but then her date was a stutterer. “I went on a blind date, and after that, I never ever did it again. The guy repeated everything he said twice,” Doolittle said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“He'd say, 'So, how are you? How are you?' and I'd say I was fine, and he'd say, 'Good, good.' I don't know if there was something actually wrong with him or if it was just a bad habit, but no more blind dates after that.”</strong></p><p>It’s definitely not fun when you don’t even want to hear your date speak, it can just make the date drag on forever. It wasn’t even the poor guy’s fault.</p><h2 id=ellie-kemper-didn-t-like-her-setup><strong>Ellie Kemper Didn’t Like Her Setup</strong></h2><p>Sometimes getting your friends to set you up on a date can be a good thing and other times it can end in disaster. You just really never know. Ellie Kemper is a seriously funny girl that we have loved on both The Office and Kimmy Schmidt.</p><p><strong>“The worst was a setup, a blind date. This particular guy was rude and he was much older than I was. He seemed pained to be there. I was like, 'Why would this person even want to go on a date?'”</strong></p><p>It’s never cool to be rude to your date especially if the person has done nothing to deserve it. She’s right, why go on a date if you’re not really in the mood for it in the first place. The guy sounded like a real jerk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andie-macdowell-didn-t-have-much-luck><strong>Andie MacDowell Didn’t Have Much Luck</strong></h2><p>Dating after a divorce can be an interesting venture for sure, especially if you were married for a long time. For one thing, the rules have all changed. "It's very odd to start dating after being married for a long time and this was one of my first dates since the divorce with my husband. My date might have only been six or seven years older than me, but my kids see me as very youthful. He came to the door to take me out.</p><p><strong>My daughter was teeny tiny at the time, and she announced, 'Mom, he is too old for you' right in front of him."</strong></p><p>Well, on the one hand, it was a huge compliment for her, but on the other, it was an awkward burn for him.</p><h2 id=bear-grylls-is-a-true-romantic><strong>Bear Grylls Is A True Romantic</strong></h2><p>You might recognize Bear Grylls as the Northern Irish adventurer, TV presenter and writer and television presenter. He is most known for the television series Man vs. Wild and he sounds like a really romantic guy. He really pulled out the stops for his date, but it ended in failure. "I made a picnic up on a mountain for a girl, with tables and chairs and three courses,” he told The Huffington Post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“It took me a full day to carry it all up there. But then she never showed, and the wind and rain blew it. The whole night was a washout."</strong></p><p>That’s terrible and we bet she regrets blowing him off. There aren’t too many guys out there that go to that amount of effort for a date.</p><h2 id=lucy-hale-wasn-t-impressed><strong>Lucy Hale Wasn’t Impressed</strong></h2><p>If you are on a date with someone, that person should have your full attention. You shouldn’t be on your phone and you certainly shouldn’t be texting another girl while on a date. We’re surprised that a girl as beautiful as Lucy Hale would have to deal with something like that, but there are jerks everywhere. "I was on a date with a guy once, and he wasn't aware that I could see his cell phone,” the actress told Glamour of her awkward date with a real winner.</p><p><strong>“He was actually texting romantic messages to another girl!"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are plenty of men out there that are willing to date more than one person at the same time without telling the girls involved. It’s a good thing that she saw the messages so she could get rid of him right away.</p><h2 id=justine-bieber-is-a-spaghetti-villain><strong>Justine Bieber Is A Spaghetti Villain</strong></h2><p>In this case, it was Justin Bieber who really blew it on his first date. He’s dated a lot of girls over the years, so it’s a given that he’s going to have a few bad dates over the years. We’re not sure how he managed such a blunder, but here it is.</p><p><strong>“I took a girl out for a first date to an Italian restaurant and spilled spaghetti all over her. It was terrible and embarrassing. She never went out with me again.”</strong></p><p>This is certainly an embarrassing situation, but unless he did it on purpose, we’re not sure why she didn’t forgive him. That’s what makes the whole situation 100% worse, the fact that she didn’t talk to him again after. Maybe he ruined her outfit, it’s hard to say without more information, but we hope that she would be a little more forgiving. But knowing Bieber, she may not have liked his attitude, to begin with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-dealt-with-a-lot-of-awkwardness><strong>Selena Gomez Dealt With A Lot Of Awkwardness</strong></h2><p>How do you think you would handle a date that was so shy that he barely spoke to you over dinner? How awkward would that be? Poor Selena! That’s exactly what she had to deal with on a first date. Selena Gomez was on a date with a really shy guy, so shy that he wouldn’t talk to her.</p><p><strong>“[The guy I went out with] was very shy, so I was sitting there trying to ask questions and fill in the awkward spaces.”</strong></p><p>That sounds like a date that would feel like it was lasting forever. Maybe he couldn’t believe that she had agreed to go out with him in the first place. Well, he certainly blew his chances. First dates are awkward enough without having a date that doesn’t talk to you.</p><h2 id=jon-stewart-asked-jennifer-aniston-out-and-she-brought-her-friends><strong>Jon Stewart Asked Jennifer Aniston Out And She Brought Her Friends</strong></h2><p>Imagine finally getting the nerve to ask the hot girl out on a date and she brings all her friends? Either Jennifer Aniston misunderstood Jon Stewart when he asked her out, or she wasn’t that into him. When she visited The Daily Show in 2010, he reminded her of their “date.” “I asked you out,” Stewart said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“And it was lovely. I remember you brought so many of your friends. And I remember thinking, ‘She’s so excited to be on a date with me, she wants me to get to know her posse.'”</strong></p><p>Aniston didn’t quite remember it that way. “If I remember correctly, wasn’t it sort of like, ‘Hey, a group of us are going out, do you want to join?'” she asked. That has to be a burn.</p><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">popcrush.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmivn6fAtXnDmquippdiwLW70aKcrGWknbK0sYxrZ2ablaGyo7%2BMsKCsoF2ptabFjJymrqSUYrOwvsaeq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
