Besides this, he has also made some breakthroughs with his entrepreneurial projects. Likewise, his futuristic solar city project is gaining a lot of popularity as well. This is a part of his philanthropy project for Senegalese inhabitants to provide them with access to electricity in <a href=#>his solar city called 'Akon City'</a> with its own digital currency, called 'Akoin.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With his impressive net worth, Akon spends generously on himself too. He has a huge collection of luxury estates, accessories, and cars. Here are some of the most expensive cars in Akon's garage.</p><h2 id=spyker-c8-aileron>Spyker C8 Aileron</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Cars Blog</a>, Akon owns a customized version of the C8 Aileron, Made by the Dutch automaker Spyker. <a href=#>The American artist customized this car</a> - it features yellow interiors and white exteriors. This color composition gives an edgy look to the supercar.</p><p>This car has a base price as high as about $354,900 and runs on a V8 engine that can reach up to the speed of 300 km/h, generating about 520 horsepower.</p><h2 id=ferrari-458-italia>Ferrari 458 Italia</h2><p>Common speculation is that the Ferrari 458 Italia is one of the most favorite cars of Akon. The musician is frequently spotted riding around the city in this beast. He has a customized version of this model as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This car runs on a 4.5-liter V8 engine that can generate about 570 horsepower and can reach a maximum speed of about 202 mph, as stated by <a href=#>Naijauto</a>.

The maximum speed of this beast is 199 mph.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamborghini-gallardo>Lamborghini Gallardo</h2><p>Another Lamborghini in Akon's million-dollar collection is the Gallardo which costs approximately $209,500. Akon is one for high speeding cars, and his favorite feature of this particular model is its E gear pattern that helps enhance the vehicle's speed in the blink of an eye.</p><p><a href=#>The Gallardo is often regarded as one of the best-selling models</a> by Lamborghini and comes with a 5.1-liter engine that can generate up to 493 horsepower.</p><h2 id=dartz-prombron-suv>Dartz Prombron SUV</h2><p>The Dartz Prombron SUV is perhaps one of <a href=#>the best-suiting sports vehicles</a> that the Senegalese-American music artist has in his exclusive collection. The hunk-like appearance of this SUV makes it the most charismatic vehicle in Akon's armada.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most other cars owned by Akon, this too is white. It runs on a V8 engine that generates 400 horsepower and has a maximum speed of 180 km/h. It also ensures optimum comfort with a back massage seat and spacious compartments.</p><h2 id=porsche-panamera>Porsche Panamera</h2><p>Yet another white car in Akon's collection is the Porsche Panamera which costs about $88,000 and is a customized version of the actual model, which is a 4-seater luxury vehicle.</p><p>The engine in this car is a V8, making the car reach a speed from 0 to 60 mph in hardly 3.5 seconds. A three-mode suspension system helps the vehicle run smoothly even while speeding. Moreover, the extraordinary black and white Saavine wheels of the Panamera are a real treat to the eyes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=audi-r8>Audi R8</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebs Car Collection</a>, Akon also owns an Audi R8. It is quite significant as it is the most expensive and <a href=#>the most attractive exotic car</a> in his collection. Like most of his other vehicles, the hip-hop star chose the color white for this model too. The car features a two-seater arrangement with extremely spacious compartments.</p><p>A V10 petrol engine powers this beast, which can generate 602 horsepower. The maximum speed of the R8 is 330 mph, and it can go from 0 to 100 mph in 3.2 seconds.</p><p>Akon has undoubtedly come a long way from being a troubled teenager to being one of the most influential and inspiring faces.
