The concept is that fans start blocking celebrities on social media for several reasons, but mainly for not using their platform to raise awareness for important casues. However, the trend has become extreme. <strong>People are not doing their research about a celebrity before "blocking" them, and TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jordxn.simone</a> has created a compelling argument for why it's time to put an end to the trend</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tiktoker-video-about-jelly-roll.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="TikToker Explains Why Jelly Roll Is Being Sued By A Wedding Band Over His Name">TikToker Explains Why Jelly Roll Is Being Sued By A Wedding Band Over His Name</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jelly Roll is being sued for trademark infringement and his fans think the lawsuit is ridiculous and bound to be thrown out.</p><p>She made a short clip detailing why things have to change. "Y'all need to pack these celebrity block lists up by tomorrow," she says in the clip. "Go ahead, finish what you're doing, and pack it up because they're getting ridiculous."</p><h2 id=why-are-the-celebrity-block-lists-getting-ridiculous>Why Are The Celebrity Block Lists Getting Ridiculous?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TikToker jordxn.simone explained why the celebrity block list started off strong, but it's no longer a trend that needs to continue. "Not only are they disorganized with the end goals and intention varying from almost person to person, which like, cool, do you … but have your own motives," she explains. "But as a movement, not very successful, but also y'all are doing no research on the people that you're putting on these lists."</p><p>She continued, "Alan Rickman was on somebody's list … why? He's dead. And even if he wasn't and you're going after him for the whole Palestine angle, he made a whole play about Rachel Corrie. If your goal is to make a block list to block celebrities who aren't using their voice to speak up about issues going on in the world, why is Quannah Rose Chasinghorse on your list? Why is Bad Bunny there? Why? On no."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TikToker jordxn.simone captioned the video with the following message, "It was a great idea, but the execution is getting worse by the day. Regroup or pack it up. #blocklist #celebrity #met #celebritynews." <strong>The video makes a lot of important arguments and a call for better research to be done, but the comments on the post are divided</strong>, while some agree and have listed the celebrities they have seen on these lists whom they feel should NOT be there, others think the intention is what matters. "Omg at least people are trying. United we stand ... not divided," a comment reads.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-should-not-be-on-the-celebrity-block-list>Paris Hilton Should Not Be On The Celebrity Block List</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The important thing the celebrity block list is doing is creating a conversation</strong>. It is also allowing people to discover more about celebrities, and TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">krizaktok</a> has come to the defense of Paris Hilton, noting the great work that she does that people often disregard. She created a post about Hilton and including a brief video from a press conference the star held at Capitol Hill.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tiktoker-mocks-zendaya-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="TikToker Playfully Mocks Zendaya's British Vogue Poses With Hilarious Videos And Fans Are Crying">TikToker Playfully Mocks Zendaya's British Vogue Poses With Hilarious Videos And Fans Are Crying</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Zendaya's leg poses for her latest photoshoot have inspired brilliant reactions, including a TikTok video of what she'll look like when she's old.</p><p>"For those of you who don't know, Paris Hilton has made it her mission to help survivors of the troubled teen industry," krizaktok shares. She then lists "a few other amazing things she is doing," including publicly supporting Harry's Law and helping to pass two reform bills in Oregon (the list goes on). The TikToker captioned her video with a message about why she can stand behind the former reality TV star. "@ParisHilton you will not be on my 2024 blockout list. More celebrities need to be like YOU. Thank you for speaking out #parishilton #greenscreen #celebritytiktok #makingchange #speakingout."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Is it true that this trend is no longer working?
