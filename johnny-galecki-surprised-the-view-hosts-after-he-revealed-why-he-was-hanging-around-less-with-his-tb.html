However, during <strong><a href=#>The Big Bang Theory's</a></strong> rise to fame, the actor took on several interviews. Among his memorable discussions took place on <strong><a href=#>The View</a></strong>.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a look back at the interview, and some of the uncomfortable questions the actor faced. Ultimately, Galecki received strong support from fans for his interview conduct.</p><p>We'll take a look at how Galecki handled a question about his sexuality. In addition, we're going to take a closer look at what Johnny said about hanging out with his TBBT co-stars behind the scenes.</p><p>Let's get started.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-25t145100-531.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Johnny Galecki's "Actor Friend" Allegedly Caused Rewrites On TBBT Because Of His Problematic Relationship With Chuck Lorre</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Not even Johnny Galecki was enough to save a guest star from his troubling experience on The Big Bang Theory alongside Chuck Lorre.</span><h2 id=johnny-galecki-told-the-view-that-the-cast-saw-each-other-plenty-on-set-and-avoided-more-interaction-off-camera>Johnny Galecki Told The View That The Cast Saw Each Other Plenty On-Set, And Avoided More Interaction Off-Camera</h2><p>It was a proud moment for Johnny Galecki on The View as The Big Bang Theory had just signed the biggest syndication deal in TV history at the time, passing <strong><a href=#>Seinfeld</a></strong> for the outstanding accomplishment. Galecki was all smiles during the interview. He even had a unique answer to if he saw his Big Bang Theory co-stars frequently off-camera. Johnny had a response fans were not expecting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said, "We don't hang out together so much anymore because they picked us up for two seasons at once.

Goldberg asked Galecki about the rumors related to his sexuality.</p><p>The host asks, "Now that we know you're not gay, can you tell us if you have a girlfriend? I can't even believe this question was one here. I should've looked at it before I said it."</p><p>Whoopi would go on to apologize for the question, while Johnny had the perfect response. He said about the gay rumors, "I've never really addressed those rumors cause I always figured why defend yourself against something that's not offensive."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-14t095432-191.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-30t173741-386.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Johnny Galecki Admitted His TBBT Mom Christine Baranski Was The Opposite Of What He Expected Behind The Scenes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Johnny Galecki had a different impression of Christine Baranski prior to her debut on The Big Bang Theory back in 2009.</span><p>A great response and fans reacted positively to Galecki's interview conduct.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Johnny gave the best answer someone can give when addressing gay rumors ....

Whichever one of you ladies gets this man damn well better count yourself the luckiest person in the world!"</p><p>"Wow, he completely ethered that gay question. Best answer I have ever heard anyone say in response to those kinds of rumors."</p><p>Fans were clearly thrilled with the way Galecki handled a very uncomfortable question on The View.</p><h2 id=in-one-of-his-final-interviews-johnny-galecki-revealed-that-his-current-interests-might-elsewhere>In One Of His Final Interviews, Johnny Galecki Revealed That His Current Interests Might Elsewhere</h2><p>Since TBBT came to an end, fans have seen very little of Johnny Galecki. However, it seems like <a href=#>he warned fans during an interview</a>. Looking at his future, Galecki seemed more interested in roles behind the camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The actor said on YouTube's Behind the Brand with host Bryan Elliot, "So tell us what's next," Elliot asks. "Right now, as far as the higher gun actor stuff I want to kind of take a break and let it run its course through my blood stream." Galecki continues, "I say that, but something always comes up."</p><p>Given his crazy schedule on The Big Bang Theory for 12 seasons, it is understandable that Galecki wanted to take time off. He was also ready for TBBT to end, but didn't like the way it all came about.</p><p>"I was shocked. We were just blindsided that day. And not necessarily shocked by Jim's decision, but that he hadn't had that conversation with his castmates first to prepare us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Galecki continues, "I stopped myself from doing so and I hugged [Jim] instead. Still, that's what literally went through my mind because it was tearing me to shreds watching Kaley break down and see the tears from everyone."</p><p>It was an emotional moment and one Galecki clearly wasn't prepared for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeo8Zus8ClnJyjmWLAtr7Pq6CsnZRiwamxjK%2Bgnq9dnby0wNJmmJ%2Bslad6qbGMq5yvnZGhsqV51qGwZqCVYsSiv4yhmKefmaO0bq3RqKynnF2hsrS%2FjLCgraBdnba0ecGinmaakaO0bsDHnqarsV2YvG6%2F05qprGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
