Ever fall totally in love with a celebrity’s outfit — as we often do with Meghan Markle’s looks — and want to recreate it yourself? It can be tough once you see the designer names (and designer price tags) involved."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It can be tough once you see the designer names (and designer price tags) involved. The actual pieces themselves are usually not too affordable, and sometimes they’re not available at all!</p><p>We try our hardest, however, to find similar pieces for less. We only share them once we’re confident with our picks, and that’s exactly what’s happening right now. Obsessed with Markle’s recent white blazer look? You’re not alone. That’s why we knew we had some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">serious shopping</a> to do!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/meghan-markle-valentino-blazer-pants.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cicy Bell Double-Breasted Blazer</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$44</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, April 19, 2022, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Markle and husband <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> recently made their return to the Invictus Games, where they unforgettably <a href=# rel=noopener>made their debut as a couple</a> back in 2017. Markle stunned from the get-go, wearing an oversized, double-breasted white Valentino blazer to the welcome reception with matching pants. Of course, that blazer costs a hefty $3,400 — and is basically sold out anyway!</p><p>And so began our search. We sifted through single-breasted designs and boldly-colored buttons until we found the one: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this Cicy Bell blazer</a>. It’s under $50, it’s on Prime and it nails the look! Like Markle’s, it’s complete with a double-breasted design, notched lapels, padded shoulders and two pockets!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cicy Bell Double-Breasted Blazer</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$44</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, April 19, 2022, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Also like Markle’s, this blazer has a roomy fit and a longer silhouette, reaching past the hip and hitting around mid- to upper thigh. And, as you can see, it comes in white! There are five other color options as well, however, if you’d prefer something else or would like to grab more than one!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This machine-washable jacket</a> can obviously be worn with <a href=# rel=noopener>white pants</a> and heels, a la Markle, but you don’t have to stop there. Wear it to elevate a pair of jeans and a tank or tee, or with a flowy romper or wide leg jumpsuit. Wear it with an oversized tee with bike shorts and chunky sneakers. Oh, and definitely wear it with dresses of all kinds: mini and midi slip dresses, especially. So chic!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cicy Bell Double-Breasted Blazer</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$44</a> at Amazon!
