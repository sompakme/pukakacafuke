I don’t wanna name her name or put her on blast, and they were eating at freaking Roscoe’s Chicken & Waffles.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“She was hot, bro. She was a beautiful Puerto Rican young girl, when we were kids. 2Pac did like this [beckoning gesture] and then she was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ll be right back,'” he continued. “30 minutes later, [her] chicken waffles got all cold, freaking syrup got all freaking stiff, butter got freaking liquidy. And he was like, ‘She ain’t coming back…’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That’s his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234751542>classic 2Pac [story]</a>.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, will.i.am <a href=# rel=nofollow>interviewed with&nbsp;Hip-Hop Confessions</a> where he gave his opinion on the popular debate of Biggie&nbsp;versus&nbsp;2Pac. Unlike majority of Hip-Hop fans, will.i.am revealed that he doesn’t listen to either rapper nor does he have a preference.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Like when people say <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234700648>2Pac and Biggie</a>, I’m such a Tribe Called Quest,<a href=# data-type=pmc-gallery data-id=1234739896> De La Soul head </a>that I don’t like 2Pac and Biggie,” he shared in a clip. “That kind of music doesn’t speak to my spirit. I like Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One, I’m like – if it’s like 2Pac or Biggie? It’s KRS-One. Why those two?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He went on, “If it’s 2Pac and Biggie, I don’t hold them up like that. I hold Eric B. and Rakim like that. 2Pac’s dope – don’t get me wrong. It’s not like I don’t think he’s dope. It spoke to the projects. My escape is De La/Tribe out the projects. It took me out the projects while I was still in the projects.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Los Angeles-native admitted that Rakim, De La Soul, and A Tribe Called Quest’s music was his “path out” of the Estrada Courts housing projects in Los Angeles as a kid.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It took me out the projects physically, as far as being able to reach my dreams, that was my path out,” he expressed. “And it took me out of the projects as far as while I was in the projects, the worlds is painted for me. It kept me safe while I was in the projects.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Had I loved 2Pac and Biggie while I was in the projects, I probably would have been stuck in the projects still.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Take a look at will.i.am’s story about apl.de.ap once having his girlfriend taken by 2Pac above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e5oq%2FKZpyynZRivaat0maYpahdmbJurc9mnqKqnGK5tr7EnWRrqJGYenJ%2Bkm1ucGlma4Vw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
