“Are those scales? What the f—k are you?” Jason’s younger brother, Travis Kelce, began the Wednesday, November 1, episode of their “New Heights” podcast.
Jason, 35, pointed out that he was dressed as “King Triton” from The Little Mermaid. The Philadelphia Eagles center rocked a sequined gold top and a DIY crown, in order to portray the underwater king — and father of Princess Ariel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Jason — who<a href=#> eagerly “modeled” his look </a>for Travis, 34 — then stood up to show the lower half of his ensemble. Jason’s look was completed with a pair of blue leggings with a scale print to replicate a merman’s tail and golden cuff bracelets.</p><p class=p1>“These are my scales! I got flippers [on my ankles],” he excitedly added.</p><p class=p1>Travis then pointed out that the “best costumes” are the ones that “don’t fit.”</p><p class=p1>After Jason pressed the<a href=#> Kansas City Chiefs tight end</a> about the fit of his look, Travis had a simple reason. “Because your belly button is showing,” he pointed out. “I don’t remember King Triton’s belly button showing!”</p><p class=p1>In 1989’s animated <i>Little Mermaid</i>, Ariel’s father was notably shirtless.

A second insider revealed that Swift and Travis, who have been linked since September, <a href=#>had even considered dressing up</a> as another famous sports couple:<a href=#><strong> David </strong>and <strong>Victoria Beckham</strong></a>. Swift and Travis have yet to confirm what they did wear on Tuesday, October 31.</p><p class=p1>Jason, for his part, spent the holiday with wife <a href=#><strong>Kylie Kelce</strong> </a>and their three daughters:<a href=#> Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 2, and Bennett, 8 months.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“We don’t have sidewalks, so we don’t have trick-or-treaters, unfortunately,” Jason teased during <a href=# rel=noopener>last week’s episode</a> of the podcast, noting he and Kylie, 31, might bring the girls to grandpa <a href=#><strong>Ed Kelce</strong></a>’s neighborhood. “[The] last couple years, Kylie’s taken the girls over to her parents’ house and they walk around the streets there.”</p><p class=p1>Jason, Kylie and their daughters are also known to <a href=#>rock matching outfits</a> on the holiday.
