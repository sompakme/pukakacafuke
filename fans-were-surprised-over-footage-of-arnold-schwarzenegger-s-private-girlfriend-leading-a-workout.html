It can't be... Not only is it true, but that has been the case for many years now. With nagging injuries, Arnold was advised to go see physical therapist Heather Milligan. Not only did she help with improving Arnold's bad shoulder, but it would also lead to a relationship between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>ET posted footage of Heather Milligan training Arnold. It was pretty surreal to see Arnold following someone else's lead in an environment that he dominated for decades. Nonetheless, Arnold credits Heather for completely changing his mindset about training. Schwarzenegger admitted he was overtraining a lot, which would lead to nagging injuries.</p><p>The workout footage is worth a look. Wall sits were among the exercises and Arnold had some fun with it, showing Heather his quads, which are still in top shape.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/arnold-schwarzenegger-confessed-to-multiple-affairs-but-only-mildred-baena-ended-up-having-his-child-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="He Only Has One Love Child, But Arnold Schwarzenegger Confessed To Multiple Affairs">He Only Has One Love Child, But Arnold Schwarzenegger Confessed To Multiple Affairs</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Arnold Schwarzenegger has admitted to various affairs, though only one produced a child with Mildred Patricia Baena.</p><p>Although Arnold's workout style has changed, he's still having a great time in the gym all these years later, and Heather is a big part of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=arnold-schwarzenegger-admires-his-girlfriend-39-s-drive-and-dedication>Arnold Schwarzenegger Admires His Girlfriend's Drive And Dedication</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold opened up about his girlfriend Heather Milligan</a> alongside People. Among the things Arnold admires most about his partner is her drive. "We have so many things in common. I think the world of her. I love that she’s into working. She’s clearly independent. She just is driven as hell.”</p><p>So how did the relationship come about? It all started after Arnold's shoulder surgery in 2012. The actor asked his surgeon for a rehab specialist ahead of an action film alongside Sylvester Stallone. It was at that point in which Heather entered the mix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/arnold-schwarzenegger-and-heather-milligan-image-4.jpg><p>"I said, 'I got to go do this movie, and I bring a lot of punches and I have fights with Sly and I want to have my act together.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And so he says, 'There's only one (person), it's Heather — any athlete, I always send them to her, because she's the only one that really knows what they’re talking about.' So I went to her, and then after my therapy was finished, after I was finished with the movie, I called her back and took her out for lunch to say thank you. And then one thing led to the next.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/inside-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-heather-milligan-s-secret-relationship.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Inside Arnold Schwarzenegger Secret Relationship With His Much Younger Girlfriend Heather Milligan">Inside Arnold Schwarzenegger Secret Relationship With His Much Younger Girlfriend Heather Milligan</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Arnold Schwarzenegger and Heather Milligan have kept their romantic relationship away from public scrutiny for a decade.</p><p>The two have clearly hit it off, and Arnold seems very content with his relationship at the moment.</p><h2 id=arnold-schwarzenegger-admits-his-body-went-through-some-tough-changes-as-he-got-older>Arnold Schwarzenegger Admits His Body Went Through Some Tough Changes As He Got Older</h2><p>Aging is a tough reality, and that holds true for Arnold as well. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were heartbroken for Schwarzenegger after he told Howard Stern about looking in the mirror today</a>. Given his previous appearance in his younger days, Arnold admits it is a tough reality looking at himself today, knowing what he used to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar52752597.jpg><p>The 76 year old tells Stern, “I kind of smile because every day I do look in a mirror and I say, 'Yep, you suck'. Look at this body. Look at the spectral muscles that used to be firm and perky and really powerful. Now they're just hanging there.' I mean, what the hell is going on here?"</p><p>Arnold went on to tell Howard that the transition is especially hard given the shape he was in throughout his life during his earlier days.</p><p>“It’s one thing to see yourself get older and more and more out of shape but most of the people have never been in shape. So what does it mean getting out of shape?” he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When you’ve been hailed for years as this supreme body, and you have the definition and you see the veins coming down your abs, and you see veins on top of your chest and then … you roll the clock 50 years and you’re standing there and you don’t see that anymore,” Schwarzenegger continued.</p><p>“I never, ever thought about that when I was 30 years old or 40 years old that this [was] going to happen.” He then added, “It just sucks.”</p><p>Arnold is certainly doing his best to combat the aging process, still regularly working out all these years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6afobFuv8Khrpqqqpq7prPGnqlmqKKew6LAxGaeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZKWdkZm2r7OMrZ%2BeZaeWxm6w1Kugp59dlnq4u9Gkpq6sXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
