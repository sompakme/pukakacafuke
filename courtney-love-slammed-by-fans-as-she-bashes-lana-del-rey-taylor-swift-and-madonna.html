She went after several of the most important pop stars in the world right now, including Beyoncé, Madonna, Lana Del Rey, and Taylor Swift.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She criticized Lana's music</a> and suggested she take a long break from music. "I haven't liked Lana since she covered a John Denver song, and I think she should really take seven years off</strong>," she said. "Up until 'Take Me Home Country Roads' I thought she was great. When I was recording my new album, I had to stop listening to her as she was influencing me too much."</p><p><strong>Courtney Love also talked about how she and Madonna have been at odds for years now. "I don't like her and she doesn’t like me</strong>." Still, she highlighted one project of the Queen of Pop which she liked, but made it clear it wasn't because of her. "I loved Desperately Seeking Susan, but for the city of New York as much as her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was kinder when talking about Beyoncé, saying that she likes "the idea of Beyoncé doing a country record because it’s about Black women going into spaces where previously only white women have been allowed, not that I like it much. <strong>As a concept, I love it. I just don’t like her music</strong>."</p><p>Backlash on social media was quick and ruthless, with people not only defending their favorite musicians but insisting that Courtney Love was only saying those things because she was desperate for attention.</p><h2 id=courtney-love-said-taylor-swift-is-not-an-39-important-39-artist>Courtney Love Said Taylor Swift Is Not An 'Important' Artist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/courtney-love-taylor-swift.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Courtney Love's comments about Taylor Swift came as a shock, as she is, undeniably, one of the most famous and relevant artists in the world right now. To say she didn't like her music would be one thing, but the Hole singer insisted that Taylor Swift was not "important" or "interesting."</p><p><strong>"Taylor is not important," she stated. "She might be a safe space for girls, and she’s probably the Madonna of now," she added, and we know how she feels about Madonna, "but she’s not interesting as an artist."</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>4:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lana-del-rey-s-video-for-born-to-die-was-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lana Del Rey's Video For 'Born To Die' Was The First To Be Filmed In An Iconic Spot In France</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lana Del Rey's music videos are often works of art with luxurious locations and enviable outfits.</span><p><strong>Of course, swifties jumped in defense of their favorite artist, attacking Courtney Love, and highlighting Taylor Swift's accomplishments.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most people will agree that Taylor's importance in the music industry is not up for debate, so Courtney Love's comments were not only surprising but also confusing. She was not expressing her dislike for Taylor Swift's music but denying her relevance, which is a difficult stance to take when she's selling out stadiums all over the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2iqbumxYylpq%2BdXai5ornMnptmnpGjwG6uwKyfnqtdoa6vrYydnKVloprGbsDAsqOoql2oxKqy02akmpyfo7uiew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
