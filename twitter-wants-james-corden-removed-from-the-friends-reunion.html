He's souring the overall experience and has the potential to have a very damaging effect on this important moment.</p><h2 id=twitter-has-no-love-for-corden>Twitter Has No Love For Corden</h2><p>James Corden has nothing to do with the show and is not related to the legendary sitcom in any way. He's not being embraced at all. In fact, die-hard fans that are seeking their nostalgic fix are highly frustrated that he's tainting their experience.</p><p>Twitter is blowing up with rage, demanding that Corden be removed, and a more suitable person be put in his place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Friends’ Reunion: Matt LeBlanc Takes Unexpected Side In Ross And Rachel Break Drama</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-aren-t-into-corden>Fans Aren't Into Corden</h2><p>Another fan wrote in to say; "<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Can I have the ‘No James Corden Cut’ please? </span><span class=r-18u37iz><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1n1174f r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#FriendsReunion</a>," while someone else said "Right? It really ticked me off hearing his voice at the end like if he were in any way affiliated with James Corden"</span></p><p>Someone cleverly wove the lyrics of the theme song in to reflect their feelings. They wrote; "So no one told me it was gonna be this way.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Cordon's hosting</a> and that's all I've got to say. I won't be watching this show anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are so many other deserving people that appeared on the show and truly deserved to have a place in the reunion show. Opting for Corden seems to be a highly unnatural choice. Nostalgic, hopeful fans chimed in to remind the producers that Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, Christina Applegate, and so many others stars actually made appearances on the set of Friends and would have been much better choices than Corden.</p><p>Twitter comments continued with; "I'm sorry if this isn't brand new information but WHY IN THE FRESH HELL IS JAMES CORDEN HOSTING PART OF THE FRIENDS REUNION???" Also: "once again i am asking... why out of all the hosts in the world.. is James Corden hosting the friends reunion? you literally could’ve had Oprah."</p><h2 id=oh-hey-now>Oh, Hey Now...</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, one fan seemed to nail it by solving the mystery. Ben Winston, the producer of the reunion show happens to be Corden's good pal.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Corden Shares The Memory Of His Most Awkward Moment With Paparazzi</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirsKGkqbKzedaapa2rXZ%2BurrHSZpqoqpSau26%2BxKamr52UYrOzu8xmq6GdXZu%2FqrHNnapmqpWqu6q7zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
