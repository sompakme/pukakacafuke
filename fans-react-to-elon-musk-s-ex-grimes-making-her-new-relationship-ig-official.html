It was not just any other celebrity birth because they chose an <a href=#>incredibly unusual name for their kid, X Æ A-12</a>. In 2022, they announced the birth of their second child, Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, who was born via surrogate.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/grimes-kanye-west-are-helping-elon-musk-is-with-his-most-ridiculous-project-yet.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Grimes And Kanye West Are Helping Elon Musk With His Most Ridiculous Project Yet">Grimes And Kanye West Are Helping Elon Musk With His Most Ridiculous Project Yet</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Elon Musk's latest project could be in trouble if he's taking advice from the wrong people.</p><p>Then, in September 2023, the couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secretly had a third child</a>. They named him Techno Mechanicus. To say that they have had a complicated relationship would be an accurate description. <strong>However, Grimes and Musk have since officially ended their relationship, and she appears to have found love again. The musician debuted her romance on Instagram by posting a photo of herself kissing EDM artist Anyma.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-have-fans-said-about-grimes-39-new-relationship>What Have Fans Said About Grimes' New Relationship?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/elon-musk.jpg><p>Fans have reacted with positivity to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post of Grimes and Anyma</a>. "They gonna have a baby, and its name is going to be a literal twig from the forest," one fan joked. "Anyma and Grimes the EDM couple final boss," another wrote.

Grimes even has music with him … he has been getting a lot of popularity lately for his shows, the visuals, and maybe his good looks," they wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer's fans are also happy she is no longer with Musk, and this is reflected in the comments. "MOTHER IS FREE FROM HER SHACKLES," one excited fan wrote. "Whoever that is, it's a f***ing relief to see," another commented. "Girlie, this is a HUGE step up from the wrinkled raisin from your past," a fan commented, referring to Musk.</p><p><strong>It's unclear how long they have been a couple, but Grimes and Anyma have collaborated before this announcement</strong>. According to Us Weekly, Anyma appeared in Grimes' song, Welcome to the Opera, in June 2023.

In March 2020, the Shinigami Eyes musician discussed her relationship with Rolling Stone, informing fans of how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her pregnancy changed her life</a>.</p><p>"For a girl, it's sacrificing your body and your freedom. It's a pretty crazy sacrifice and only half of the population has to do it. It was really profound to me when I decided I was going to do it," she said. "... I'm just like, 'I have sacrificed my power in this moment. I have, like, capitulated.' And I have spent my whole life avoiding that situation. I have never capitulated to anything, so it was just a profound commitment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-53.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Grimes Refused To Take Money From Elon Musk, But Not For A Reason Anyone Expected">Grimes Refused To Take Money From Elon Musk, But Not For A Reason Anyone Expected</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Elon Musk might be rolling in dough, but Grimes wanted none of it.</p><p>Musk and Grimes ended their relationship several times. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She announced another breakup in 2022 </a>following the birth of their second child.
