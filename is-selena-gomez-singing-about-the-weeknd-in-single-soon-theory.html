The line raised eyebrows with listeners, especially since she mentioned “the weekend” in the following breath.</p><p>In the “Single Soon” music video, Gomez can be seen writing a Post-It note that reads, “I’m sorry I can’t don’t hate me,” seemingly breaking up with her lover.</p><p>One TikTok user was <a href=#>quick to make a video</a> about the Post-It note, explaining how it’s <a href=#>a Sex and the City Easter egg</a>. However, several commenters took it to mean something else entirely, calling out Gomez’s split from The Weeknd.</p><p>“Selena literally says the weekend is here as she puts the note down,” one social media user wrote. Another added, “AND THE WEEKEND IS HERE AS SHE PUTS THE NOTEEEEEE.”</p><p>A third speculated that Gomez “just brought out weekend song.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/is-selena-gomez-singing-about-the-weeknd-in-single-soon-theory-01.jpg><p>TikTok wasn’t the only social media platform abuzz with speculation. “Omg is SINGLE SOON about when she broke up with The Weeknd to get with Justin Bieber?” one Twitter user questioned.</p><p>Gomez hasn’t publicly addressed who or what “Single Soon” is about, but she did tease that it’s the start of her SG3 era.</p><p>“Y’all have been asking for new music for a while,” Gomez <a href=#>shared via Instagram</a> on August 17. “Since I’m not quite done with SG3, I wanted to put out a fun little song I wrote a while back that’s perfect for the end of summer.”</p><p>Gomez seems to be <a href=#>embracing her single girl era</a>, as expressed in this song and on her TikTok account. “I’m single! I’m just a little high maintenance but I’ll love you so much,” she yelled to a soccer field filled with men <a href=#>in a video shared on June 8</a>. Gomez made the same claim in her “Single Soon” lyrics, singing, “I know I’m a little high maintenance / But I’m worth a try,” in the second verse.</p><p>Throughout her time in the public eye, Gomez has been romantically linked to a few stars, but two relationships stand out from the rest. She dated <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> on and off from 2011 to 2018. During one break in their relationship, Gomez dated The Weeknd from January to October 2017. They even attended the <a href=#>Met Gala</a> together that year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite their breakup, a source told Us Weekly in March 2020 that <a href=#>the former flames are “cordial”</a> and even support each other’s musical endeavors.</p><p>“Selena is a fan of The Weeknd and his music,” the insider shared at the time. “She has no negative feelings toward him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCsZaOauaa6wGaeqKWVr3q0tc2goKefXZavsMHTZquhnV2ssqa3zZ1koqZdqLavs8ueZKynn6N6tbTEqKmyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
