When an Instagram user noted that their gemstone-inspired names “went well together,” the new mom replied, “We besties forever.”</p><p>The Grammy nominee welcomed Onyx with her ex<strong> Playboi Carti</strong>, and the former couple coparent the little one. “<a href=#>Onyx is so loved by his dad</a> and has always had both parents in his life from day one,” Azalea wrote via Instagram in October 2020, days after saying she was “not in a relationship” and “raising [her] son alone.”</p><p>In December 2020, the songwriter wrote via Instagram that <a href=#>she initially wanted to “work on” her relationship</a> despite her claims that Carti was unfaithful. “Having a baby even one you both want can be a big change, so I had been doing what I felt was best for my family,” she explained. “Every time I’ve said I’m happy to send a nanny with Onyx to Atlanta this man would say, ‘I only want to see him if you are there too, I want to see my FAMILY.’”</p><p>The model called Carti “trash” that same month for <a href=#>missing Christmas with their son</a>: “Too bad you got an album out but can’t even come to Christmas with your own son. Imagine not flying out your family on Christmas but you have the girl you cheated on my entire pregnancy at your album party and magically me and my son can’t come for Christmas anymore?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prior to her relationship with the “Meh” rapper, Azalea was engaged to NBA player <a href=#><strong>Nick Young</strong> </a>from 2015 to 2016.
