Styles' Early Days</span></h2><p>Before A.J. Styles was soaring through the air like a human missile, he was just another kid with big dreams and a lot of heart. Born at a Marine Corps Base in North Carolina, Styles grew up in a not-so-privileged family, which made life tough. That, however, didn't stop him from pursuing <a href=#>his passion for wrestling</a>. Although his family couldn't afford cable TV, Styles still found a way to hone his craft, becoming a two-time state wrestling champion in high school. After graduating, he attended Anderson University on a wrestling and physical education scholarship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it wasn't until some friends invited him to try professional wrestling that Styles found his true calling. He started working at a <a href=#>professional wrestling school</a> to see if he had what it takes, all while supplementing his income by mowing lawns and driving an ambulance. Talk about a jack of all trades! And speaking of family, Styles is a devoted Christian and puts God first, followed by his family. With four kids and a wife who's a school teacher, Styles is proof that hard work and dedication can pay off, both in and out of the ring.</p><h2 id=the-start-of-styles-professional-career>The Start Of Styles’ Professional Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A.J. Styles is a professional wrestler known for his work in TNA/IMPACT Wrestling and WWE. He began his career in 1998 and quickly established himself as a rising star, winning <a href=#>his first championship</a> in 2002. He became known for his high-flying moves, technical wrestling ability, and charismatic personality. In 2003, he joined TNA Wrestling and became a key member of the X Division, winning the X Division Championship multiple times.</p><p>He later became a world champion, winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship three times and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice. He also won the NWA Tag Team Championship and the TNA World <a href=#>Tag Team Championship</a> multiple times, mostly with tag team partner Christopher Daniels. In 2016, he joined WWE and won the WWE Championship twice. Styles is widely regarded as one of the best wrestlers in the world and has won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="A Look At Helen Hunt's Career In Hollywood" href=#>A Look At Helen Hunt's Career In Hollywood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-j-styles-wrestling-career-at-its-prime>A.J. Styles’ Wrestling Career At Its Prime</h2><p>This American wrestler has accomplished so much since joining WWE in 2016, it's almost mind-boggling. He burst onto the scene at the Royal Rumble, winning fans over with his high-flying moves and incredible athleticism. And since then, he's racked up championship wins like they're going out of style, taking home <a href=#>the WWE Championship</a>, United States Championship, and Intercontinental Championship, just to name a few. Styles' greatest triumph may have come at WrestleMania 37, where he teamed up with the towering Omos to win the Raw Tag Team Championship. They held onto those belts for an impressive 133 days before losing them to the likes of RK-Bro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's be real, losing to Randy Orton and Riddle is no small feat. But Styles and Omos didn't back down, and they fought tooth and nail to try and reclaim those titles. Sadly, <a href=#>they were unsuccessful</a> at Crown Jewel in October 2021, but Styles never let the loss get him down. Instead, he bounced back by challenging Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship at Elimination Chamber in February 2022. Though he didn't come out on top, he proved that he was still a force to be reckoned with in the ring. He then set his sights on Edge, but even with the help of his Bullet Club buddy Finn Bálor and Liv Morgan, he couldn't quite get the <a href=#>job done at WrestleMania</a> Backlash. That's the thing about A.J. Styles; he never gives up and that's why fans love him. He's a true wrestling superstar who never rests on his laurels.</p><h2 id=his-numerous-championships-and-achievements>His Numerous Championships And Achievements</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A.J. Styles’ wrestling career is a success story written in gold ink! He has won titles and accolades that many wrestlers can only dream of.
