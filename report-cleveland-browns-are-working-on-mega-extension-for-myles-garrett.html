Garrett has two more years on his rookie deal; the Browns already picked up his fifth-year option for the 2021 season.</p><p>Drafted first overall by the Browns in 2017, Garrett has emerged as the new franchise superstar in Cleveland. He's recorded 30.5 sacks through his first three NFL seasons, a total of 37 games.</p><p>Garrett recorded 10 sacks and two forced fumbles in 10 games last season. The year before, he set a career-high with 13.5 sacks.</p><p>The Browns have wasted several top 10 draft selections over the past two decades, but Garrett has been an exception. He's asserted himself as one of the game's elite defensive players, and he'll be one of the highest-paid pass rushers real soon.</p><p>NFL Network's Ian Rapoport previously reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garrett could receive $25 million annually on his next contract</a>. This would make Garrett the highest-paid defensive player in the league.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Report] Tom Brady Was Interested In Signing With The New Orleans Saints</a></strong></p><p><figure></figure></p><p>The Browns were a popular pick to make the postseason last year, but they finished with a disappointing 6-10 record. That prompted ownership to make several changes, with head coach Freddie Kitchens and general manager John Dorsey losing their jobs. They were replaced by former Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski and former Philadelphia Eagles executive Andrew Berry, respectively.</p><p>Signing Garrett&nbsp;would go a long way in helping the Browns build towards the future as they try to end over two decades of frustration. He's the type of player that any head coach wants to build a defense around, and Cleveland looks ready to pay him accordinly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Garrett and the Browns will open up Week 1 of the 2020 season against reigning MVP Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Photo] Fan Art Depicts Colin Farrell As The Penguin For "The Batman"</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6tomqKkxK%2B%2FjKucqaeiqbKluNhmrqiqm567qHnOp2SesKSau7S1zqdksKGknXquxcueqmafkae%2FpsDTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
