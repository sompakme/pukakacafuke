Lamar Odom showed his love and affection for his girlfriend, Sabrina Parr, in an unusual way as he sucked on her toes in a new video.
In Parr’s Instagram Stories, the couple cozied up in the backseat of a moving vehicle.

At the time, he shared a picture of the businesswoman posing in workout gear, captioning the post with a Malcolm X quote.</p><p>“It’s just like when you’ve got some coffee that’s too black, which means it’s too strong, what do you do? You integrate it with cream … But if you pour too much cream in it, you won’t even know you ever had coffee,” the quote read. “It used to be hot, it becomes cool. It used to be strong, it becomes weak. It used to wake you up, now it puts you to sleep.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sabrina-Parr-Lamar-Odom-2.jpg><p>He tagged Parr in the post, adding the hashtag “#BlackRoyalty.”</p><p>Odom and Parr addressed their relationship during <a href=#>a joint interview with Dish Nation</a> on August 12.

He was sick, he needed to heal, he needed to grieve. He experienced a lot of losses. And he never had time to go through that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Odom was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> from 2009 to 2016.
