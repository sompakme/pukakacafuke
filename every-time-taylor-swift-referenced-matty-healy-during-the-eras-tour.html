Swift took the stage for the first time since TTPD dropped on Thursday, May 9, in Paris. In addition to giving TTPD its own era, she also changed up her wardrobe and rearranged her setlist to make room for her new songs.
The singer performed several songs from TTPD for the first time, including “But Daddy I Love Him,” “So High School,” “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me,” “Down Bad,” “Fortnight,” “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Swift and Healy have been connected since 2014 but had a <a href=#>short-lived romance</a> in June 2023 following her breakup from Alwyn.)</p><p>As Swift rocked the stage for the TTPD segment, many fans noticed right away that there were several potential homages to the 1975 frontman.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how Swift subtly referenced Healy during The Eras Tour:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Swifties-Think-Taylor-Swift-Subtly-Referenced-Matty-Healy-During-the-TTPD-Section-of-The-Eras-Tour-000.jpg><h3>The Infamous March and Salute</h3><p>While performing “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” which is rumored to be about Healy, Swift <a href=#>seemingly shaded her ex</a> by performing one of his go-to bits. Healy famously marches and salutes the crowd at his concerts whenever he sings “Love It If We Made It.”</p><p>As Swift belted the ballad, she dramatically marched down the stage and saluted the audience as she completed her walk. Fans were quick to pick up on the possible dig.</p><p>“I immediately caught that. Such a DIRECT call out. He does it every performance of [‘Love It If We Made It’],” one user commented on a TikTok clip of footage from the concert.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>Carrying a Lifeless Frame</h3><p>Swift dramatically ends “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” by being carried away by two of her dancers. They gently place Swift on a couch as she gears up her next number.</p><p>The choreography is similar to Healy’s onstage scene when he is also carried by a man in a coat to a sofa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Swifties-Think-Taylor-Swift-Subtly-Referenced-Matty-Healy-During-the-TTPD-Section-of-The-Eras-Tour-001.jpg><h3>Self-Touching</h3><p>During the choreography for “So High School,” which is seemingly about <a href=#>Swift’s current boyfriend</a>, <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>, Swift is sitting around with her dancers. When she gets to the line, “Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto,” she lightly rubs her hand down her chest, mimicking what Healy has done during his live shows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyvnaKuerW1zJ5krZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXaeyp7HRnqWcnZRiuqLA07JkoZ2RocZusNSroKefXam1pnnEq5isZaSkwrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
