Catherine O’Hara has a soft spot for her hit holiday film Home Alone — but her family isn’t as over the moon about it.
“I love it,” the 67-year-old actress told E! News on Wednesday, November 10, of being part of so many fans’ movie-watching traditions. “Because I have my own and there’s movies that I have to watch every Christmas.”
The Schitt’s Creek alum pointed to 1942’s Holiday Inn, 1945’s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and 1946’s It’s a Wonderful Life as her go-to holiday picks, before mentioning 1990’s Home Alone."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In both the films, <a href=#>Kevin’s family manages to forget about him</a> — first he’s left home in Chicago by himself and then he accidentally flies to New York instead of getting on a plane with his big brood.</p><p>More than three decades after the <a href=#>John Hughes</a>’ movie hit theaters, the Canadian actress is still recognized for her role as the frazzled, but ultra-protective Kate. In fact, O’Hara recently teamed up with <a href=#><strong>Kevin Hart</strong></a> to spoof the hit holiday film as part of <a href=#>Chase’s latest Freedom Unlimited campaign</a>.</p><p>In the commercial, the actress dons her movie husband Peter McAllister’s (the late John Heard) iconic tan coat as she shops in a big department store. When she realizes that Kevin is missing, O’Hara screams his name in a similar fashion to that of the two movies.</p><p>“I can’t believe you lost another Kevin,” Hart, 42, says in the ad after finding O’Hara, to which she replies, “It’s a holiday tradition!”</p><p>While promoting the partnership, O’Hara also reflected on <a href=#>a few more of her family traditions</a>, including getting a “really fresh tree” that she keeps up until February.</p><p>“Baking. I love to bake,” she told the outlet, noting that as a kid she had a lot of wonderful Christmases with her parents and six siblings. “My dad would go outside the house and <a href=#>pretend to be Santa</a>. They would buy pajamas and my mom would go in the bedroom and say, ‘Oh, Santa’s here.'”</p><p>The <a href=#>Best in Show actress</a> kept that tradition alive with her own kids, sons Matthew, 27, and Luke, 24, whom she shares with husband <strong>Bo Welch</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I did that for years with my kids. My husband and I, he’d go outside and ring the bell [as the kids listened from behind the locked door],” she explained. “I bet they’ll still go along with it if I asked them.”</p><p>O’Hara previously paid tribute to her Home Alone character by <a href=#>recreating her iconic “Kevin!” scream</a> in a TikTok video in November 2020. It received more than 3.5 million views within the first few weeks of it going live.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqarJiav6q6xGamoZmilnqqecearZ5lpKR6p7vRnJxmpaliuKqw0marqGWnlsGktIyhpqadXZa5sLrEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
