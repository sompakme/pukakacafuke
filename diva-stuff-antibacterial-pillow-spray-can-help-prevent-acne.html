It’s a fact of life: Pimples and other skin blemishes happen for a variety of reasons. If we don’t wash our faces, dirt and other oils can clog our pores — causing blackheads or whiteheads to pop up."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We don’t always think about how much time we truly spend in bed (especially these days) — and how infrequently we might be washing our pillowcases. Our faces are constantly pushed against our pillows, and dirt and bacteria can easily build up. That’s where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this product</a> comes into play!</p><p>All you have to do is spray <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this mist</a> on your pillow or other surfaces that come in contact with your face frequently, and you’re good to go! The key ingredient in this formula is tea tree oil. This is a natural antiseptic that is commonly used to fight acne and other pesky problems. And combined with this spray’s soothing lavender scent, this item can make your sleep a lot more enjoyable!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Diva-Stuff-Anti-Bacterial-Travelers-Mist-Coconut.jpg><p><strong>Get the</strong> <strong><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diva Stuff Anti-Bacterial Pillow + Travelers Mist</a>&nbsp;for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10</a>, available at Amazon! </span></strong><strong><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Get it as soon as Thursday, March 26, 2020.
