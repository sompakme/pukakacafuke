People said that her videos were very entertaining, especially in the worrisome times during the pandemic. Soon she had over 50,000 fans on TikTok.</p><p>Livingston had also worked for the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) during the 90s and she used to live in Baltimore, MD before she moved to Kenya a while before the pandemic. Some people often often mistook her and thought she belonged to the Kikuyu community, but her daughter clarified that her mum was actually a Luo from Suba.</p><p>Nayoko’s thoughts on Livingston’s death were:</p><p>“Death has robbed Kenyans an amazing woman and no matter what her content was, her soul was precious and she deserves to be celebrated.”</p><h2>Cause of Death:</h2><p>While some sources reveal that the cause of her death could be cancer, her daughter stated that her mother had not been feeling well for the past two weeks and even after a medical examination, the doctor told them that everything was fine. Even earlier this week she said that she was feeling a lot better up until the morning of death. She passed away on the way to the hospital.</p><p>She had spoken to many of her friends the morning of her death and even told them that she was feeling better which is why the entire family is still in shock because of her sudden death due to reasons unknown.</p><h2>Funeral:</h2><p>Many details have not been given out yet except her daughters set up a GoFundMe account to collect around $6000 to give their mother the heartfelt farewell she deserves. One of her daughters is reported to have said that they plan on honoring their mother between the dates of September 18th and September 22nd.</p><p>Source: <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=#>uptospeedjournalism.com</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2S5sK%2FApWarnZKasKStjKWgr6GenMC1u81o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
