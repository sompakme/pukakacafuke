Well, you can.

According to Arekkz Gaming, this is the fastest way to farm Exotics at the moment, due to the Three of Coins &#34;Stackable effect that increases the changes the next Ultra you defeat will drop an Exotic Engram.&#34;
What this means, is you simply use one, kill an Ultra, and there's a chance of an Exotic Engram dropping."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In this case, Eye of the Gate Lord in the Waking Ruins. The reason this mission was chosen in the video, is that it extremely easy to get to the boss and drive past a lot of the quests.</li></ul><ul><li>You will obviously have to stop off at the pillar in the beginning, deploy your Ghost, drive all the way through, take out the Hydra, run up to the boss, and that's pretty much it. Each time you go through it will only take you between two and three minutes to get to the boss.</li></ul><ul><li>Before you trigger the boss when stepping in the ring, open up your inventory, use your Three of Coins, and then go kill the boss.</li></ul><ul>As soon as he is defeated, look on the floor to see if he has dropped an Exotic Engram. If he hasn't, pull out your Ghost and go back to<li>orbit and then load back into the mission. If you go back into orbit before the countdown timer the next time you go into the mission you will spawn right at the boss.</li></ul><ul><li>You can then open another Three of Coins, walk into the ring, kill him again, and check for an Exotic drop.</li></ul><p>Obviously your lucky may vary, and Arekkz said he had to do this seven times using seven Three of Coins before the boss dropped an Exotic.</p><p>Upon being decoded, the Engram <a href=#>turned into the Year Two Exotic helmet Skyburners Annex</a>.</p><p>This confirms the mission will not only drop a Year One, but a Year Two as well.</p><p>And that's all there is to it. Try it out for yourself and see what you get.</p><p>If you need to know what Xur is selling this weekend, and where he's located, we have you covered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7ORbW5nm5%2BifKWx0q2gp7FdqbWmedOaop6mXaC2r7OMoaawZaSkeqet0aZknrCfqbakv4ytn6udlWK8p3nCqKCnqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
