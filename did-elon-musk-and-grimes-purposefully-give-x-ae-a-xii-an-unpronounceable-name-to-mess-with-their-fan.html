During their relationship, it was clear that the billionaire and the Canadian <a href=#>music</a> producer and performer were a unique couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Between <a href=#>Grimes saying the Grammys are irrelevant</a> and <a href=#>Musk's unusual spending habits</a>, both of them are willing to go out on a limb. With that in mind, nobody should have been surprised that Musk and Grimes didn't give their son a traditional name. Still, the former couple's name was so unique that some have wondered if it is a joke.</p><h2 id=were-elon-musk-and-grimes-joking-when-they-named-their-son-x-aelig-a-xii>Were Elon Musk And Grimes Joking When They Named Their Son, X √Ü A-Xii?</h2><p>Over the last several years, Elon Musk has become one of the most talked about people in the world. With some people loving Musk and others hating him, one of the most remarkable things about the billionaire is that he often doesn't seem to care how he is perceived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/elon-musk.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similar to Musk, his ex-partner Grimes seems to be a fiercely independent thinker. Given the perception of Musk and Grimes, it makes sense they were a couple and that they gave their son an unusual name.</p><p>When Grimes gave birth to the son she shares with Musk, the couple initially announced the child's name was X √Ü A-12. After many people felt confused by that name, the couple later revealed they had to change their son's name to X √Ü A-Xii. The reason for that was the original version of their son's name "violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet".</p><p>Putting aside the strange fact that Musk and Grimes were forced to change their son's name, many observers were left with a lot of questions. Most notably, people who saw the headlines wanted to know how to pronounce Musk and Grimes' son's name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elon Musk And Jeff Bezos Are Two Of The World's Richest Men, But They Flaunt Their Net Worths Very Differently</a></span></p><p>In yet another surprising twist, it turns out that Musk and Grimes have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">described how to pronounce their son's name differently</a>. For that reason alone, it is understandable that some people question if their son's name was meant as a joke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/does-elon-musk-have-a-relationship-with-his-oldest-kids_.jpg><p>More notably, Musk's public image has played a huge role in people questioning his son's name. While there is no doubt that Musk is a business leader, he also refuses to restrain his sense of humor on social media even though it has gotten him in trouble in the past. Musk even went so far as to show up at Twitter headquarters carrying a kitchen sink after he paid $44 billion for the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If all of that wasn't enough to think that Musk and Grimes might give their son a joke name, all you have to do is look at the couple's history. According to reports, Musk and Grimes got together in the first place because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they shared a similar nerdy sense of humor</a>.</p><h2 id=why-elon-musk-and-grimes-named-their-son-x-aelig-a-xii>Why Elon Musk And Grimes Named Their Son X √Ü A-Xii</h2><p>Right off the hop, it is important to note that at the end of the day, only two people truly know why Elon Musk and Grimes named their son X √Ü A-Xii. That said, based on the publicly available information, observers can conclude the likely motivation behind that name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/claire-elise-boucher-also-known-as-grimes-at-paris-fashion-week.jpg><p>Based on what has been revealed since Musk and Grimes' son was born, it seems extremely likely the couple wasn't joking when they named him. There are a few main reasons to draw that conclusion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first and most obvious reason to think the couple wasn't joking around is that it has been years since their son was born. Since Grimes gave birth on May 4th, 2020, it certainly seems like the former couple would have revealed they were joking by now if they were.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Elon Musk's Mom Maye More Involved In Co-Parenting His Children With Grimes Than He Is?</a></span></p><p>Of course, it is theoretically possible that Musk and Grime were joking around and never intended to let the public in on that. However, if that were the case, it seems unlikely that there would be such an elaborate meaning behind their son's name.</p><p>In a tweet she posted the day after her son was born, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimes explained the meaning behind X √Ü A-Xii's name</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elon-musk-holding-his-son-x-ae-a-xii.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"‚Ä¢X, the unknown variable ‚öîÔ∏è ‚Ä¢√Ü, my elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial intelligence) ‚Ä¢A-12 = precursor to SR-17 (our favorite aircraft). No weapons, no defenses, just speed. Great in battle, but non-violent ü§ç + (A=Archangel, my favorite song) (‚öîÔ∏èüêÅ metal rat)"</p><p>Again, it is possible that Musk and Grimes came up with a joke meaning for their son's name. However, it is hard to believe the former couple has kept the joke going for years now and Grimes took the time to tweet a fake explanation of her son's name while recovering from giving birth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Elon Musk Have A Relationship With His Oldest Kids?</a></span></p><p>On top of that, there is another compelling reason to think that X √Ü A-Xii's name isn't a joke. On top of welcoming their son into the world, Musk and Grimes had a daughter via surrogate and the name they gave their second child is revealing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Musk and Grimes' daughter was born, it was announced they named the child Exa Dark Sider√¶l Musk. While that name certainly is more traditional than X √Ü A-Xii, it still is unusual and it seems notable that both of their kids have the character √¶ in their names.</p><p>Later in March 2023, Grimes tweeted out a rare photo of the couple's daughter with an update on the child's name. When someone replied to Grimes' post by gushing about the toddler, the musician responded with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an update on the name that she and Musk call their daughter</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/did-elon-musk-and-grimes-purposefully-give-x-ae-a-xii-an-unpronounceable-name-to-mess-with-their-fans_.jpg><p>"She's Y now, or "Why?" or just "?" (But the government won't recognize that). curiosity, the eternal question, .. and such."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Musk and Grimes had previously called their son X, and now they call their daughter Y, it seems like they are very serious about their naming scheme.</p><p>Finally, there is one more thing to consider, Musk's fascination with the letter X. For a long time now, Musk has spoken about wanting to create a super app called X. Furthermore after Musk bought Twitter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it is now part of a company he owns called X Corp</a>. Clearly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Musk has a deep appreciation for the letter X</a> so it seems unlikely he is joking about his son's name starting with that letter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmrmwuoymrKyjXZa7pXnGq6CmnaNitKrCxGavZpmVYq5uxMiiZJqmXaq7sb7Op6auppOarqO4xGalmqWVYsGwecyeqqxlp57BqXnToZyiql2brq%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
