According to The Washington Post, Home Depot stated that they terminated Rucker because he failed to “disengage and alert management about a customer confrontation,” spokesman Matthew Harrigan wrote in an email to the paper."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Still, Mr. Rucker made up his mind about not returning back to the store after working there for 10 years. In hindsight, he says, he always felt ostracized while being there.</p><p>“I went to work every day thinking I could be fired. Every task I did, I wondered if I could get fired for this,” Rucker said. “There was a passive bias toward me at that particular store.”</p><p>“I felt like there wasn’t a whole lot of love for me there,” he continued.</p><p>NBC division WNYT News reported that&nbsp;he&nbsp;recalled that the day of the incident, the customer told him, “’If Trump wasn’t president, you wouldn’t even have a job. … You’re from the ghetto, what do you know?’”</p><p>“You’re lucky I’m at work right now because if not, you wouldn’t be talking to me like this,” Rucker replied to the man, according to The Post.&nbsp;Instead of going back to Home Depot, Rucker opted to drive for Lyft and continue his music career. Nonetheless, he’s gotten a lot of support. Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy has reportedly called Rucker to offer him some employment with the county government.</p><p>“No one deserves to be treated with such hostility, and I was concerned with the way the situation was handled. [His] former colleagues and customers have all attested to his professionalism at work, and I look forward to meeting with him,” McCoy told The Post through a spokesperson.</p><p>“What happened to Mr. Rucker was nothing short of an injustice,” he continued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e5oq%2FKZqSapl2btrOxw2adq6edYrWwucRmm56on6l6sMLEq2SrmZOewLV5wq6qraedmr9uw86nq2askaCybq7AnKJmoJmoequ7wWZscm9oa4Vw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
