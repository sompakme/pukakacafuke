The musician bought the condo in 1998 for $2.8 million. She lived there for 25 years before choosing to sell.</p><p>Despite New York’s infamy for small apartments, the condo boasts 2,094 square feet of living space, which includes 3 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Located on the 34th floor of a luxury building, the amenities include a high-tech gym, swimming pool, spa, and valet parking. There’s also 24-hour room service and housekeeping.</p><p>The listing boasted the condo’s views on Manhattan, which includes Central Park. Every room features floor-to-ceiling windows, offering a breathtaking view.</p><p>The singer hasn’t disclosed a reason she chose to sell her long-time home. But she gave a statement after putting it up for sale, explaining how much joy the space had given her over the years.</p><p>"Whenever entering my apartment of 25 years, I always treasured my home's wonderful location and the breathtaking views that capture the magic and excitement of New York,” Janet explained.</p><p>“Stepping through its threshold instantly made me feel so tranquil and at peace—so many memories,” the pop star added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the NYC apartment with new owners, Janet certainly isn’t short on properties. She has a variety of investment properties scattered across the United States, including in Nevada and California.</p><p>According to <a href=#>SCMP</a>, Janet owns several homes in California as well as a 4.436 square foot house not far from Las Vegas. She bought the property in 2002 for $520,000. Following her separation from <a href=#>her ex-husband, Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana</a>, Janet relocated with her son to London in 2019, where they’d previously lived as a family.</p><p>With an estimated net worth of $180 million, it’s not surprising Janet has invested in so much property. But it remains to be seen if she’s eyeing anything new now that she’s washed her hands of her NYC condo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Brad Pitt To Pay $20.5 Million To Hurricane Katrina Victims Over Faulty Houses</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Mansion Global</a>, <a href=#>SCMP</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmajmZ6awW62wJyirKeeqHqvxcJmmqimlKR6tK3LnmSwmaNirm6wyKyYqaifnru1ucSnq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
