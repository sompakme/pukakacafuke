John Mulaney and Olivia Munn were spotted out and about for the first time since their relationship made headlines last month.
In new photos, the comedian, 38, and the Predator actress, 40, giggled as they spent time together at Rick’s Drive In & Out in Los Angeles. Both were dressed casually in t-shirts and sunglasses as they enjoyed their meal seated side by side.
Us Weekly confirmed that the pair are dating in May, one week after the comedian confirmed to Us he had split from his wife of six years, Anna Marie Tendler."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At the time, a source told Us that <a href=#>the move was a “relief” to those close to Mulaney</a>.</p><p>“John has always been engaged in his sobriety. The relapse got ugly, but it was his choice to go to rehab, which saved his life,” the insider explained.</p><p>At the time, Munn wished him well via Twitter.</p><p>“Sending SO MUCH love and support to John Mulaney. You got this,” the Newsroom alum wrote.</p><p>The Oklahoma native has <a href=#>publicly shared her adoration</a> for the<a href=#> Saturday Night Live</a> alum before.</p><p>“We were at a wedding together and I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, do you and your [Tendler] want to go have dinner or something and go hang out?’” Munn recalled during a 2015 conversation with HuffPost Live. “At first it was cool, and then I kept going up to him at the wedding like, ‘So, you having fun?’ I was just so obsessed with hanging out with and talking with him.”</p><p>The Buddy Games actress then attempted to get a hold of her now-beau via email — but he never responded.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I might’ve got the wrong email — probably,” she said at the time. “That’s what I tell myself.”</p><p>Prior to her relationship with the Chicago native, Munn was linked to <strong>Tucker Roberts</strong>. The duo <a href=#>broke up amicably at the end of 2019</a>, a separate source told Us in August 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7C0zWakrqSRo7K6ecCnm2annJ7Dqq2Mpqynpl2au6u72GajrqaTnXqlrdOeZKKmXaG8tHnAp56epJWofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
