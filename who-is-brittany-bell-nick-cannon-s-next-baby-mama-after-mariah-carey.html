Which camp does Brittany Bell fall into?</p><h2 id=nick-cannon-has-three-children-with-brittany-bell>Nick Cannon Has Three Children With Brittany Bell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nick-cannon-1.jpg><p>Nick Cannon welcomed his third, fourth, and tenth children with Brittany Bell. Together, they share Golden Sagon (born in 2017), Powerful Queen (born in 2020), and Rise Messiah (born in 2022).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nick didn't make a big show out of sharing the births of his third and fourth children, simply sharing photos of his baby mama on social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nick Cannon Believes His Relationship With Kim Kardashian Could've Worked If Not For One Incident</a></span></p><p>Once Powerful was born, however, everything changed. Less than six months after Brittany Bell's third child with Nick was born, he was having twins with someone else.</p><p>Then, Brittany and Nick's third child together was born in the same calendar year as four other babies that Nick had with Bre Tiesi (<a href=#>who was married up until connecting with Nick</a>), LaNisha Cole, Abby De La Rosa, and Alyssa Scott.</p><h2 id=how-does-brittany-bell-feel-about-nick-cannon-39-s-lifestyle>How Does Brittany Bell Feel About Nick Cannon's Lifestyle?</h2><p>While some of Nick's baby mamas (some consider themselves his partners) are content with their arrangement, others don't seem to be as much. Bre Tiesi has gone to bat for Nick and <a href=#>even feuded with a Selling Sunset co-star</a> over the matter of Nick's fatherhood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In contrast, despite his claims that <a href=#>he spends the most time with their daughter Onyx</a>, LaNisha Cole has seemingly dragged Nick for forgetting to list their baby among his dozen kids.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brie Tiesi May Not Need Nick Cannon's Support; Here's How Much She's Worth</a></span></p><p>So what has Brittany Bell revealed about her relationship with Nick Cannon? Not much, at least not on her social media. While Nick often has a public rapport with his kids' moms, specifically commenting on Bre Tiesi's Instagram often and appearing in photos with her, Nick makes very few appearances on Brittany Bell's social media.</p><p>While he commented "fire" emojis on a post of Brittany out with their son, his reactions and replies to her posts are scarce. In the past, like on Easter 2022, Nick appeared in photos with his three kids, but since then, it's almost radio silence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bell, who is a past Miss Universe competitor and winner, completed her Master's degree while pregnant and pursued her Ph.D. after having her second baby. But in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview discussing her accomplishments</a>, Bell only briefly mentions her children's father, calling her daughter "our baby."</p><p>In speaking about her first child, Bell stated that she "discovered the power of Motherhood" after she "became a mother to Golden, [her] son." Bell also explained that her Mama Gang movement/brand grew from a desire to teach her kids "how to thrive cognitively, emotionally, and mindfully despite anything that they are surrounded by…"</p><p>And sure, the interview was focused on Bell's brand and experiences as a mom, but she never once mentions a partner in any of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-nick-cannon-and-brittany-bell-on-good-terms>Are Nick Cannon And Brittany Bell On Good Terms?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nick-cannon-golden-cannon-and-brittany-bell.jpg><p>Given Nick Cannon's penchant for having as many children as he feels he can handle, it would make sense that Brittany was aware of his lifestyle choices if not before they had their first two kids together, but definitely before they welcomed the third.</p><p>Yet Nick has spoken about how it's difficult managing all his relationships with his kids' mothers, though he hasn't made it clear which he is actually in a romantic relationship with, though he has expressed love for Bre Tiesi, Abby de la Rosa, and LaNisha Cole on social media.</p><p>Fans may also recall that before he had a dozen kids, Nick had relationship troubles when Brittany got pregnant.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Over $3 Million Of Nick Cannon's Net Worth Goes Toward His 12 Kids, But What Else Does He Splurge On?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview, Nick's ex-girlfriend Jessica White claimed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she didn't know Nick was dating anyone else</a>, and that she found out her live-in boyfriend was having a baby with someone else via the parents' Instagram reveal. However, Us Magazine notes that Bell and Cannon's second child was conceived while Cannon and White were "on a break."</p><p>White announced she had broken up with Nick (after five years) in August 2020; Bell's second child was born in December.</p><p>When their first child arrived, Us Magazine points out, Nick and Brittany said they were not dating, and the two appear not to be together today. There also is no evidence of bad blood between the two, only speculation given the absence of gushing on social media.</p><h3 id=does-nick-cannon-pay-brittany-bell-child-support>Does Nick Cannon Pay Brittany Bell Child Support?</h3><p>Brittany appears to have some money of her own and an education to back up her career, but she is said to receive child support from Nick. <a href=#>Cannon pays a massive amount of support</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly pays Brittany around $80K per month</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurtGiq62Znq56o7HLpWSnoZOgeqStzaemp2WSlq%2B6ecyapJpn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
