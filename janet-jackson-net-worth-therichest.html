As the youngest of the famous Jackson clan, Janet has always enjoyed the spotlight. Few celebrity siblings can emerge from the shadows of their already famous relations to become superstars in their own right and with their own distinct personalities. That's exactly what Janet Jackson did in becoming one of the biggest female pop and R&B stars of the '80s and '90s. Since her breakthrough in 1986 with the album Control, Jackson's career as a hitmaker has been a model of consistency, rivaling Madonna and Whitney Houston in terms of pop chart success over the long haul.A big part of the reason was that Jackson kept her level of quality control very high; her singles were always expertly crafted, with indelible pop hooks and state-of-the-art production that kept up with contemporary trends in urban R&B.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, the Late M.J's kid sister has sold over 100 million records worldwide and landed 10 No. 1 singles on Billboard's Hot 100, she is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music.&nbsp; Her album, 20 Y.O., hardly made a blip on the charts, but don't count Miss Jackson out. Tours have proven a substantial cash cow for the seasoned performer.</p><p>She was the youngest of nine children in the Jackson family, and her older brothers had already begun performing together as the Jackson 5 by the time she was born. Bitten by the performing bug at a young age, she first appeared on-stage with the Jackson 5 at age seven and began a sitcom acting career at the age of ten in 1977, when producer Norman Lear selected her to join the cast of Good Times. Janet Jackson was born May 16, 1966, in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of ten children, to Katherine Esther and Joseph Walter Jackson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January 2012, Janet married Qatari businessman Wissam Al-Mana.&nbsp;In April 2017, the couple called it quits and decided to pursue a divorce, just three months after their son Eissa was born. The couple agreed&nbsp;to a shared custody of their only child.</p><p>In June 2018, the couple made the headlines when the singer reached out to the authority following the report of her son's nanny regarding Wissam's aggressive behavior, which apparently frightened the infant. The nanny had to lock herself up in a bathroom just to call Janet and report the untoward behavior of Wissam. The singer immediately called the police to check on her son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earnings-amp-financial-data>Earnings & Financial Data</h2><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Date</p></th><th scope=col><p>Category</p></th><th scope=col><p>Description</p></th><th scope=col><p>Amount</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>Record Sales</p></td><td><p>Estimated earnings from her album Unbreakable</p></td><td><p>$260,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Sponsorship</p></td><td><p>Earnings from sponsorship deals</p></td><td><p>$81,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>Cumulative Album Sale Earnings (as of 2013)</p></td><td><p>$260,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>Earnings from concert tours</p></td><td><p>$458,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Project Earnings</p></td><td><p>Cumulative Book and Publishing Earnings (as of 2013)</p></td><td><p>$81,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2008</p></td><td><p>Record Sales</p></td><td><p>Estimated earnings from her compilation album Number Ones / The Best (certified gold by BPI)</p></td><td><p>$100,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2007</p></td><td><p>Record Sales</p></td><td><p>Estimated earnings from her album Discipline (certified gold by RIAJ)</p></td><td><p>$2,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2005</p></td><td><p>Record Sales</p></td><td><p>Estimated earnings from her album 20 Y.O.
