The Tesla founder walked the red carpet at the Met Gala with Canadian singer Grimes, confirming their rumored romance. The sighting comes a few months after Musk parted ways with Amber Heard, who was also in attendance at the event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Musk and Grimes, real name Claire Boucher, have been keeping their romance under wraps for the past few months. Their appearance at Met Gala marked their debut on the red carpet and confirmed that they are officially dating.</p><p>Musk rocked a white suit for the event while Grimes when with a corset dress and knee-high boots. She also donned a Tesla-inspired choker. The couple apparently designed their matching outfits – Musk’s suit featured a Tesla pin – during a dinner date. The theme for this year’s Met Gala was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.</p><p>Although Musk has been private about his romantic life, he has not been afraid to show his love for Grimes on social media. A few months back, Musk commented on Grimes’ music video for her song, “Venue Fly,” calling it the best he has seen in a long time. While it is great to see Musk moving on, Heard was also at the Met Gala this week, which definitely raised some awkward conversations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Musk and Heard started dating in the fall of 2016. According to <a href=#>ETOnline</a>, the pair made their romance official in 2017 before splitting up a few months ago. Shortly after the breakup, Musk admitted that it “hurt bad,” so it is good to see that he has found love once again.</p><p>Musk has been married three times. He married Talulah Riley twice and Justine Musk. The Space-X founder divorced Riley a second time in 2016.</p><p>Musk and Grimes have not commented on their romance.</p><p>As far as Heard is concerned, the actress tried her best to keep composed during the Met Gala. Despite Musk bringing his girlfriend to the event, Heard rocked two different dresses and refused to give in to the embarrassment. Heard wore striking crimson dress and gold headpiece for the first portion of the evening before slipping into a shimmering red gown to attend a few after parties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Amber Heard</a> looked gorgeous in both dresses and seemed like she had a good time under the circumstances. Heard did not say anything about Elon Musk’s new girlfriend and was not accompanied by anyone at the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nlaG8r3nMrqqkZZentq6x0maZq52RoMKxecCmmZ6qXZ2yor7DaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
