It hurts, it does.”</p><p>Chrisley filmed the emotional footage in her bedroom. Speaking to her fans, she recalled the early stages of her relationship with Hanks.</p><p>“It’s so funny whenever I look back at Blaire and I and just the fun times we had. It truly was the definition of young love. It’s just what he and I were. We had so much fun, and things were amazing,” she said. “We were best friends.”</p><p>The now-exes have always been open about their romance, both on the USA Network series and on social media. However, Chrisley hinted that the “spotlight” may have taken a toll on them.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“It was hard to keep the relationship just to ourselves. Maybe that’s why we are at the point that we’re at now … Sometimes you can just go through so much in a relationship that it wears on you,” she explained. “It wasn’t his fault, it wasn’t my fault. There was fault on both sides.”</p><p>The news comes just one week after Chrisley <a href=#>broke her vertebra in a serious car crash.</a> She did not <a href=#>wear her neck brace</a> in her video on Wednesday night.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaaWu6%2Btx2aaoaqZqLmmxYybo5qhopp6qa3NpKpmq6ChtrV5wJ%2BrnqpdqcSwediemKurXaSzbrDAraCnn12sgXd%2FkGptaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
