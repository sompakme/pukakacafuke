She’s easy, she’s smiley, she’s chill, very chill.”</p><p>The reality star also gave credit to Aubree and her husband.</p><p>“Having Aubree’s help has been amazing. She loves helping. She plays with her brother when I need her to,” Chelsea told the outlet. “I mean, Cole is just great all around. I’m more of the laid-back parent and he’s definitely more paranoid and worried all the time, which is funny because it’s usually the mom, but I mean, he’s so helpful. He changes diapers. He gets in there. He does it all.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through for Chelsea and Cole’s relationship timeline:</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bpsqa6jKampmViqHqktMSlqp6ZXZ28tr%2FKmmSappRisLC4xGabnpqfmr%2B0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWStoZ2auaq6xGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
