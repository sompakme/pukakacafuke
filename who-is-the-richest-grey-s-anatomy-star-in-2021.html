The popular medical drama, which was recently renewed for <a href=#>an 18th season</a>, has had a tremendously devoted fan base since its 2005 premiere. Viewers stuck with the show as some of their favourite characters were <a href=#>killed off</a> (or in some cases,<a href=#> fired off screen</a>), and as the drama escalated behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How to Save a Life: The Inside Story of Grey’s Anatomy, a new book by Lynette Rice, revealed that Patrick Dempsey, who played the role of Derek “McDreamy” Shepherd, the brilliant brain surgeon and devoted husband to Dr. Meredith Grey, <a href=#>terrorized his colleagues on se</a>t. Though Dempsey made an appearance in season 17 of Grey’s, the book reveals a darker, tension-filled time on set. Ellen Pompeo, who plays series lead Meredith Grey, alluded to the drama, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> “It’s funny: I never wanted off the bus in the year that I could get off. The first 10 years we had serious culture issues, very bad behavior, really toxic work environment.”</p><p>17 seasons and many cast departures and new additions later, Grey’s Anatomy seems to be as solid and as popular as ever. But which cast members, new and old, have the net worth to show for it? Here are the richest cast members, ranked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What These Former 'Grey's Anatomy' Actors Have Done Since Leaving The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=ellen-pompeo---80-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ellen Pompeo - $80 million</span></h2><p>We should expect nothing less from the woman who plays the titular character on Grey’s. In 2018, Ellen Pompeo told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporte</a>r she had re-negotiated her salary and was now making $575,000 per episode - which translated into $20 million per season, making her the highest paid actress in dramatic television. Cha ching! Not bad for someone who initially didn’t want to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stuck on a TV show</a>. Pompeo’s producing credits and re-negotiated salary put her networth in the ballpark of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$80 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-dempsey---80-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Patrick Dempsey - $80 million</span></h2><p>When Patrick Dempsey first graced our screens as the beautiful McDreamy, he was actually considered the star of the show and being <a href=#>paid more</a> than Ellen Pompeo. He was arguably the best known cast member at the time, after having appeared in movies such as Lover Boy, Sweet Home Alabama, Enchanted and Made of Honor. At the height of the show’s popularity, Dempsey was earning up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$350,000 per episode</a>, equal to $8 million per season and resulting in his net worth of $80 million. Dempsey’s departure from Grey’s was the catalyst to Ellen Pompeo renegotiating her salary and finally being paid more than her ex-costar (and former on-screen husband).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katherine-heigl---30-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Katherine Heigl - $30 million</span></h2><p>Though Katherine Heigl had been acting since the early 1990’s, including a stint on Roswell, it was her portrayal of Dr. Isobel “Izzie” Stevens on Grey’s that led to her big break and her impressive<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $30 million</a> net worth. At the height of her Grey’s fame, Heigl starred in Knocked Up, The Ugly Truth, and 27 Dresses. Though Heigl’s exit was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial,</a> to say the least, it did allow for her to branch out into movies and star in Killers, Life as We Know It, New Year’s Eve, One For The Money and TV shows such as Suits and Firefly Lane. She recently said she hasn’t ruled out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a return</a> to Grey’s Anatomy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Grey's Anatomy’ Fans Lose It Over The Return Of Kate Walsh For Season 18</a></span></p><h2 id=sandra-oh---25-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sandra Oh - $25 million</span></h2><p>Sandra Oh made Dr. Cristina Yang a fan favourite early on, and her incredible acting skills have allowed her to flourish outside of the Grey’s Anatomy universe. Oh eventually worked her way up to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$350,000 per episode </a>salary, making between $8 million and $9 million per season. Oh has since starred in the critically acclaimed Killing Eve, and is getting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rave reviews</a> for her performance in the new Netflix series The Chair.</p><h2 id=kate-walsh---20-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kate Walsh - $20 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kate Walsh recently announced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her return</a> to Grey’s Anatomy after departing the show during season 3 to star on her own spin-off, Private Practice. After 6 seasons of Private Practice, Walsh seemed to have found a home on Netflix, starring in 13 Reasons Why, Emily in Paris, and The Umbrella Academy. Walsh reportedly earned around $175,000 per Grey’s episode, and her additional Netflix contracts likely contributed to her<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $20 million net worth.</a></p><h2 id=jessica-capshaw---20-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jessica Capshaw - $20 million</span></h2><p>With her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 million net worth</a>, Jessica Capshaw is one of the richest Grey’s cast members that wasn’t part of the original group, joining the show in its 5th season as Dr. Arizona Robbins. Before her scene stealing Grey’s role, Capshaw starred in TV series such as The Practice, ER, and Odd Man Out.

His time on Grey’s led to his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $18 million net worth</a>, and he recently signed on to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">play Marlon Brandon</a> in an upcoming mini-series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Ellen Pompeo Keep Acting After 'Grey's Anatomy' Ends?

The actor and activist has earned his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$12 million net worth</a> through roles in films such as The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 and The Cabin in the Woods, and appearances in TV shows such as Little Fires Everywhere and Station 19.

The actor has been acting professionally since the 1970’s, appearing in films such as 42, How Stella Got Her Groove Back, and Nixon, and TV shows such as The X Files, JAG, Roseanne, and Doogie Howser M.D. Pickens Jr is one of the only remaining original cast members of Grey’s Anatomy alongside Ellen Pompeo and Chandra Wilson. He has appeared in almost <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">400 episodes</a>, which undoubtedly explains his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$13 million net worth</a>!</p><h2 id=chandra-wilson---10-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chandra Wilson - $10 million</span></h2><p>Chandra Wilson is likely best known for her role as Dr. Miranda Bailey on Grey’s Anatomy, though she has also appeared on The Cosby Show, Sex and the City, Law and Order, and The Sopranos. Alongside her co-stars Ellen Pompeo and James Pickens Jr, Wilson completes the trio of the only original cast members left on Grey’s from season 1.
