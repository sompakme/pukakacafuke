During its 11-season run, the show has won a ton of Emmy Awards and overwhelming praise from critics. The show even shined a spotlight on its talented cast, <a href=#>all of whom became household names</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sarah Hyland played Haley on the show. <a href=#>Her character was involved in a love triangle with Andy</a> (played by Adam Devine), who was in a relationship with a girl named Beth. Beth was played by Laura Ashley Samuels and despite being an enemy of Hyland's character on the show, the two are actually a lot closer in real life.</p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-and-laura-ashley-samuels-39-characters-were-involved-in-a-love-triangle>Sarah Hyland And Laura Ashley Samuels' Characters Were Involved In A Love Triangle</h2><p>Hyland's character Haley developed feelings for Andy (played by Adam Devine) after meeting him at her grandfather's house. <a href=#>He was hired by Gloria</a> to be a "manny" and the two hit it off pretty quickly.</p><p>However, Andy was in a serious relationship with Samuels' character Beth, who lived two hours away. The two had been together for over eight years, but Haley still developed strong feelings for Andy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time the two realized their deep feelings for each other, Andy was already engaged to Beth and Haley was back with Dylan. At that point, both characters believed they wouldn't be a good fit for each other. They ultimately decided to stick with their current partners before Andy and Beth broke up later. Beth would reveal to Andy that she was seeing someone else.</p><p>"I couldn’t feel more different from Beth," <a href=#>Samuels told Medium</a>. "Beth was in the Coast Guard, which I would never be in, and she really loved ugly sweaters, which I’m not a fan of. Also, she’s a little bit more jealous than I would ever be, and she ended up turning out to be a cheater herself. So, I wouldn’t say I’m anything like Beth at all, really."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hyland herself said she enjoyed the love triangle <a href=#>when speaking to Yahoo! in 2015</a>.</p><p>"There’s always something in the way for them," she told the outlet of Haley and Andy's relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ty Burrell Almost Lost His Role On Modern Family To Brendan Fraser, Here's What Happened</a></span></p><p>Hyland also looked toward the future and wasn't happy when thinking about the show coming to an end.</p><p>"I can’t even imagine it ending," Hyland admitted. "I’d just be bawling all the time."</p><p>Samuels similarly gushed about the show, complimenting its writing.</p><p>"Modern Family has intelligent humor," she said. "They have this family dynamic that’s also so wholesome, and it’s a show that the entire family can watch together. It’s funny for everyone. They have extremely well-written jokes, so they’re not doing fart jokes or sex jokes. The writers and producers were brilliant."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-actresses-are-actually-best-friends-in-real-life>The Two Actresses Are Actually Best Friends In Real Life</h2><p>Haley and Beth strongly dislike each other on the show. Haley ridiculed Andy when finding out about his relationship, calling Beth a made-up girlfriend. She even made fun of a video Andy was making for Beth with the help of Phil.</p><p>However, while the characters are enemies on the show, the same can't be said for real life. <a href=#>According to IMDb</a>, Hyland and Samuels are actually best friends.</p><p>When speaking to Medium, Samuels discussed her experience working on the Modern Family set.</p><p>"Working with the cast of Modern Family was very fascinating because I got to see Sofia Vergara, Julie Bowen, and Ed O’Neill do their thing," Samuels said. "I was surrounded by some of the greatest comedic talents of all time on one of the greatest shows of all time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52347700.jpg><p>She continued, "And I, again, had this imposter syndrome, just like, 'Wow, I can’t believe I’m here right now on this set with these people. This is just absolutely insane.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Nathan Fillion Really Felt About Playing Sarah Hyland's Boyfriend On Modern Family</a></span></p><p>Samuels was particularly excited to work on the same set as Ed O'Neill.</p><p>"Ed O’Neill is a classic," she gushed. "To see him do his thing was truly just amazing. I grew up watching Married with Children, and he’s been someone that I’ve just known for a long time. It really is special to get to work with him and share a set with him. Working with your idols is probably up there with the most fascinating things about the job."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-hyland-revealed-the-advice-she-would-give-to-her-younger-self>Sarah Hyland Revealed The Advice She Would Give To Her Younger Self</h2><p>Modern Family would eventually come to an end in 2020 after 11 seasons. In 2023, <a href=#>Hyland spoke with E! News</a> about her experience and what she would tell her younger self back when the show began in 2009.</p><p>"Don't be too hard on yourself," she began. "Love the people around you, but love you more."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52260100.jpg><p>She added that she would tell her younger self to keep dancing.</p><p>"Continue dancing because you love dancing," Hyland said. "Get back to ballet, and get back to jazz, and flamenco, and ballroom, and all of that. Get back to that world, because you desperately miss it in your thirties and now you don't have the muscles to perform it anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Unlike Modern Family Co-Star Ariel Winter, Sarah Hyland Decided To Stay In California And Buy A Farmhouse</a></span></p><p>Hyland also shared how close she is with her Modern Family cast mates. When husband Wells Adams proposed, he not only asked Hyland's real parents for their blessing, but her T.V. parents as well.</p><p>"When my fiancé proposed, he asked my mom and dad for their blessing," Hyland said. "Then he also hunted down Julie Bowen and Ty Burrell for their blessing. They really, really are like my second set of parents."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqJyVp7tussCmoKWxXZq7prnInqpmq5Gnrql5x7KjmqaUYq6vsIylmK6qkWLAornUnqOsZZGnsm6uxKyrZp6inrKvsNJmoKdlopqurXnLop2eZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
