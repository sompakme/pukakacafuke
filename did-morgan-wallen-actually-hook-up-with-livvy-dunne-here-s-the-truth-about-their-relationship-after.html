She is part of the women's gymnastics team at Louisiana State University.</p><p>According to DeuxMoi, Morgan Wallen and Livvy Dunne hooked up, and people wonder if they are dating now. A TikTok video from the account Before They Were Famous shared the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumor about Wallen and Dunne</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/morgan-wallen.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the TikTok video, the host said, "Admittedly, that rumor is about as unconfirmed as it gets.

She was also wearing cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. This made fans more curious about whether Morgan Wallen and Livvy Dunne are dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Is Morgan Wallen Really Like, According To People Who've Met Him</a></span></p><p>No one is sure if the stars are actually together, and they haven't confirmed a relationship or commented on the rumors. However, Livvy Dunne did see Wallen perform in Oxford, Mississippi in April 2023, according to Whiskeyriff.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Sun reported that Dunne and her friend Elena Arenas went to the concert and wore cowboy boots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/olivia-dunne-outside.jpg><p>Dunne seems to be a part of the country music scene now. Brobible.com reported that she attended The Academy Of Country Music Awards in May 2023 and wore a silver dress.</p><p>It could be true that Wallen and Dunne have started dating... but it could also just be a rumor. It might just be that she likes Wallen's music and wanted to go to his concert in Oxford with a friend. Until the stars say that they are in a relationship or nothing has ever happened between them, no one will know for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February 2023, The Sun reported that Livvy Dunne shared a video on TikTok where she said "bf reveal" but then didn't say anything more. People wondered if this meant that she didn't want to talk about who she was dating. But people also said it could have meant that she wasn't seeing anyone at all.</p><h2 id=why-did-morgan-wallen-cancel-his-concert>Why Did Morgan Wallen Cancel His Concert?</h2><p>The news that Morgan Wallen and Livvy Dunne could be dating came as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallen canceled one of his concerts</a>.</p><p>According to USA Today, Wallen was supposed to have a second tour date in Oxford, this time at the University of Mississippi's Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. But he ended up canceling. While Dunne did get to see Wallen sing the night before, this second concert didn't happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/morgan-wallen-4.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to USA Today, the singer said, "After last night's show I started losing my voice so I spent the day resting up, talking to my doctor and working through my vocal exercises trying to get better. I really thought I'd be able to take the stage and it kills me to deliver this so close to showtime, but my voice is shot and I am unable to sing. All tickets will be refunded at point of purchase. I am so sorry, I promise you guys I tried everything I could."</p><p>Since Wallen told his fans on social media with not much notice, it's no wonder that they were surprised and wondering what was going on. It's definitely disappointing to show up at a venue and realize that a band or singer isn't going to be there after all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Deeper Meaning Behind Morgan Wallen's Best Songs Reveal The Truth About His Troubled Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while Wallen said that he had lost his voice, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people wondered if the concert was canceled</a> because of something else. According to Billboard, a security guard said that he hadn't lost his voice after all. When a fan inquired about whether Wallen had been drinking and that was why he couldn't sing, the guard said yes.</p><p>Seth England, the CEO of Big Loud, posted a statement that Best Crowd Management had written. The statement said that what this wasn't true at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/morgan-wallen-1.jpg><p>The statement explained, “A hired employee of BEST Crowd Management made false claims as it related to last night’s Morgan Wallen concert and we do not stand behind the detail in his statement. Please refer to Morgan’s social media pages for details.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>England wrote, “Thank you @bestcrowdmanagement for correcting your employee, who made up an entire story that was nowhere close to true. Every detail was false. Laughable what some people will just say for a reaction. Don’t Believe Everything You Read.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Morgan Wallen Amassed His $4 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>According to Entertainment Weekly, a Morgan Wallen fan sued him because of the canceled show. The fan said that it was negligence and breach of contract.</p><p>Entertainment Weekly reported that the lawsuit said that the canceled concert had been pricey for the fan and that they were upset about it. The lawsuit said, "Even if ticket prices are refunded, no offer has been made to reimburse concertgoers for other out-of-pocket expenses they incurred in connection with the concert cancellation, including transportation, lodging, food, merchandise sales, transaction fees, and other such expenses."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the lawsuit didn't go very far at all, as federal court didn't allow it to go forward, the fan's lawyer, Casey Lott, gave an interview to The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal. Lott said, "The (first) lawsuit was mistakenly filed based on a misunderstanding. The lawsuit has been dismissed and the case is closed. We plan to refile the class action lawsuit with a new plaintiff in the coming days."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoryzs8CnZLCZnKGyr3nHqKakZaWleri106FkqKSZq7aiecOupaedXZmutbXNoGSanqSav260yKxknJmemLKtscNmmqimk5q%2FtXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
