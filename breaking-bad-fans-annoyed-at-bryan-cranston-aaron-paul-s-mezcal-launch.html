He captioned the photo ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù and Cranston, 63, posted the same photo with an identical caption. Given that the duo played Jesse Pinkman and Walter White, respectively, on the award-winning drama for five seasons from 2008 to 2013, fans were quick to assume a Breaking Bad reboot or movie was in the works.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bryan-Cranston-Aaron-Paul-Dos-Hombres-Mezcal-02.jpg><p>Those theories were strengthened by the fact that the former costars‚Äô identical social media posts came four months after Variety reported that a Breaking Bad sequel film was in pre-production at Netflix. According to the outlet, the movie is slated to follow Paul‚Äôs character Jesse and start streaming on Netflix one week after airing on AMC. Series creator and producer, <strong>Vince Gilligan</strong>, was reportedly attached to write and direct the sequel. Cranston, for his part, was not attached to the project, nor was he expected to appear, as his character presumably died in the series finale.</p><p>Fans were whipped into a frenzy yet again when Paul and Cranston shared a photo of themselves together on Tuesday, July 2. This time, the duo were shown walking in a shallow body of water with their shoes in their hands. ‚ÄúEven sooner,‚Äù the caption teased.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bryan-Cranston-Aaron-Paul-Dos-Hombres-Mezcal-03.jpg><p>By Tuesday, July 9, the cat was out of the bag, as the one-time scene partners revealed they had started a mezcal brand together called Dos Hombres. ‚ÄúThree years ago we sat in a sushi bar in New York. Talking about life and what we could possibly do down the road together. We had the time of our lives while shooting Breaking Bad and truly built a very special bond. Knowing that we couldn‚Äôt share the screen for quite a while ‚Äì our thoughts turned to a new project,‚Äù the joint post began. It went on to note that Paul was the one to suggest he and Cranston create a ‚Äúreally special‚Äù mezcal together.</p><p>To craft their unique spirit, which is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from agave, the pair set out to Oaxaca, Mexico and searched ‚Äúhigh and low‚Äù before finding their ‚Äúplace.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt was on a dirt-road, in tiny village, hours away from the center of town, we found it and it was perfect. Holy sh‚Äìt it was perfect,‚Äù the caption continued. ‚ÄúWe looked at each other and just simply nodded. This is it.‚Äù</p><p>According to the pair, the ‚Äúlong and crazy journey‚Äù in search of their mezcal was well worth the wait. ‚ÄúWe are crazy about the taste, the aroma, and the versatility of this smokey, age-old alcohol,‚Äù the caption stated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bryan-Cranston-Aaron-Paul-Dos-Hombres-Mezcal-01.jpg><p>However, not everyone was pleased by this announcement. Many Breaking Bad devotees were upset the news wasn‚Äôt related to the cult show in some way. One peeved social media user even directed a tweet specifically at Paul, writing, ‚ÄúYOU TROLL.‚Äù Scroll down for some additional annoyed reactions to the Dos Hombres announcement.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>You mean to tell me that for two weeks, Bryan Cranston made me think that he and Aaron Paul were doing a Breaking Bad related project, just to find out they‚Äôre teaming up to make some liquor.
