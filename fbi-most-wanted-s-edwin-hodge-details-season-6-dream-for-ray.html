Just hopefully they’re not the horrible ones,’” he continued. “So I think we all need a guide in life, and hopefully that is Ray for Caleb.”</p><p>While Hodge has his own vision for Ray as a parent, he teased that he doesn’t know “too much” about the writers’ <a href=#>plan for season 6</a>.</p><p>“I’m like an audience member sometimes when it comes to this stuff. I don’t want to know. I want to be on the ride, too,” Hodge confessed. “But what I do look forward to is really expanding on the relationship, the complexities, the new complexities of the relationship, and just the new cases that we have. We get some crazy, crazy cases.”</p><p>In addition to diving into Ray’s personal life, Hodge told Us that he’s open to doing a bigger crossover with the original FBI cast down the line. “I love <strong>Zeeko [Zaki]</strong>,” Hodge said of<a href=#> the FBI actor</a> who plays Special Agent Omar Adom “OA” Zidan on the mothership series.</p><p>Hodge recalled working with Zaki, 34, on Six in 2017 when Zaki was the bad guy on the show. “I fell in love with his ambition, his drive,” Hodge recalled. “He was a recurring guest star, but you just knew he had it, whatever it was, you just knew he had it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added: “If I could play alongside anybody, go to any one of them, it would be FBI because I really do enjoy working with Zeeko and <strong>Missy [Peregrym]</strong>. I’ve had the chance to work with Missy, as well, and she’s delightful too.”</p><p>Season 6 of FBI: Most Wanted will premiere on CBS in fall 2024.</p><p>With reporting by Yana Grebenyuk</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ2boV2ivLTAjLCYp6yVmcBuscOwoKdlmKSxqLGMnZytmZmhwG6%2FxJqqqKZda3qlvsSapGaen6d6s63YaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
