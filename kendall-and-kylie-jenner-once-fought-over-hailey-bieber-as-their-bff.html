Initially, the burgeoning friendship caused friction. Jenner shared, “At first, Kylie was mad; I had to bring them back together and be like, ‘No, it’s okay, guys.’ But it’s all good; that’s our love story.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-and-hailey-grew-to-be-friendly-over-time>Kylie And Hailey Grew To Be Friendly Over Time</h2><p>It’s no secret that Hailey’s husband is none other than pop superstar Justin Bieber.

But as they sip cocktails and throw back tequila shots, the two also endearingly took time to celebrate each other’s successes.</p><p>Bieber commended the growth of Jenner’s cosmetic empire, Kylie Cosmetics, "I've always been so inspired by that.” And Jenner threw the compliment right back. “First, I want to say that I’m so proud of you and that I love Rhode,” giving a shout-out to Bieber for starting her own skincare line.</p><p>“I remember when I used to compliment your skin when we were like 16,” she said. “You used to tell me about these products and ingredients, and I didn’t even know what that meant at that time.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Kendall, Kylie And Hailey Bieber Cook A Holiday Meal: Here's What They Ate">Kendall, Kylie And Hailey Bieber Cook A Holiday Meal: Here's What They Ate</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenner continued, “[Kylie Cosmetics] been through a lot. I’ve grown so much, and I’ve learned so much about makeup, and it really is my passion.”</p><p>“That really shines through, and I think you really see that through your products,” echoed Bieber.</p><p>To end the special, the two indulged in a bit of cheeky fun and friendly competition, playing games like cauldron pong, followed by a round of shots, or two, and concluded the day with the infamous photo that circulated social media of witchy Kylie lounging in Hailey’s bathtub.
