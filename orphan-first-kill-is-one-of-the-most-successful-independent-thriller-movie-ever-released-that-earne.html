Although August has been a lighter month for theatrical releases, an old genre friend, Esther, has returned to liven up the box office in Orphan: First Kill. The prequel to the 2009 cult classic film was released over the weekend on Paramount+ and every digital service imaginable, but Paramount also gave the film a small theatrical release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While that might seem like a small number, it would not be fair to compare this prequel to many of the major horror releases or its shocking first film. Orphan received a full theatrical release in 3743 theaters and made $12.8 million in its opening weekend. It’s hard to believe that First Kill wouldn’t at least have matched that number if it had received a full theatrical release. Especially given the popularity of Orphan, which went on to make $77.9 million and First Kill currently sits at $2.19 million at the worldwide box office, which doesn't include what the prequel made on home rental services like VUDU.</p><p><a href=#>As of September 3, 2022, Orphan: First Kill has grossed $41,596,251 in domestic, $36,316,000 international, and $77,912,251 worldwide.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the <a href=#>box office results</a> of First Kill, it can be seen that audiences were willing to see this kill-happy horror story in theaters. Esther is arguably on the Mount Rushmore of modern horror villains and this box office result should at least tell you the high quality of the first film. However, First Kill was also helped by the fact that it has gotten great word-of-mouth. As it stands right now, this delightfully entertaining prequel has been better received and reviewed than its predecessor Orphan.</p><p><strong><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Scary Rich: Highest Paid Horror Directors Ever, Ranked By Films</a></span></strong></p><p>First Kill, a prequel to Orphan, features the winning formula of the first film and completely turns it on its head. First Kill was most well known for its insane twist, while this prequel doesn’t top what was done in that film—it presents another satisfyingly crazy twist that will make you sick to your stomach. This prequel is not just your average horror sequel that was only made to be a cash grab; it gives Esther an actual story to kill in and embraces the fun campy nature of Orphan. However, the icing on this sweet horror cake is <a href=#>Isabelle Fuhrman</a> who once again gives another jaw-dropping and scary performance as Esther.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The box office performance of First Kill is a testament to the enduring popularity of horror icons like Michael Myers and Ghostface. While she isn’t a moneymaker like those icons, Esther is nearly as frightening as them. The fact that Orphan: First Kill was released in theaters so quickly—less than two months after its initial release on Blu-Ray—only proves that there is still an audience for her brand of terror. If a third film in the franchise does come to fruition, it will be interesting to see if Paramount can take advantage of this opportunity. For now, you can watch Orphan: First Kill by yourself or with friends at home by purchasing it from your favorite digital movie service.</p><p>According to <a href=#>the review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes</a>, The film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 115 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The website's critic's consensus reads: "Leaning into its ludicrous premise, Orphan: First Kill is a sequel that holds its own—and for fans of campy horror, may even represent an improvement on the original."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Gigi and Bella Hadid Rare Dual Appearance Has Been Spotted at US Open With Their Stylish Outfits</a></span></strong></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Collider</a>, <a href=#>TechCodex</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS8s7zHmqVmnpmnwLV5yqKjpWWZqHqwusRmpp9lpJ2ybrnOrKtmq6WYsKa%2F0p%2BspWWZo7GmvMSnm56mpGLBqb7IpaOeql2ivLe1xGacr52iYr%2BmuMSaqp6cXam1osCMnpirppWZeniDjKagpaSZpLtuw86ro52vmZmycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
