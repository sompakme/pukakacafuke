According to insiders who spoke with TMZ, <a href=#>Jonas had been raising their children alone</a> while he was on tour. These sources also mentioned that the couple had distinct lifestyles, with Jonas preferring a quieter home life while Turner enjoyed socializing.</p><p>However, fans swiftly gathered evidence to challenge this portrayal of Turner, asserting that individuals close to Jonas might have been responsible for spreading negative narratives to tarnish her reputation.</p><h2 id=how-did-the-nasty-divorce-rumors-between-joe-jonas-and-sophie-turner-start>How Did The Nasty Divorce Rumors Between Joe Jonas And Sophie Turner Start?</h2><p>Insiders close to the couple revealed that Joe Jonas has been putting in tremendous effort to salvage his marriage with Sophie Turner, and he deemed it appropriate that filing for divorce was his final, desperate measure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fans-compiled-joe-jonas-history-of-blaming-women-amid-divorce-from-sophie-turner.jpg><p>According to TMZ, sources close to the couple have pointed out the contrast in their lifestyles, highlighting that Turner enjoys a more social and party-oriented existence, while Jonas prefers the comforts of home. This seems to be a calculated approach, subtly touching upon the theme of Turner's alleged active social life potentially hindering her domestic role within the family.</p><p>According to Vogue, it appears as though Team Jonas is subtly weaving a narrative of Turner as a less-than-ideal parent, without explicitly stating it. Instead, they are heavily insinuating that her penchant for going out clashes with Jonas' preference for a home-centered lifestyle. It's a case of reading between the lines, implying that Turner may not be meeting the expected standards of motherhood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cosmopolitan also reported that Turner felt that her life as a young adult abruptly halted when she married Jonas at the age of 23. Sources close to her conveyed that she felt confined in her new role as a wife and mother, which was further compounded when she spent time in the UK and realized how much she missed her home country.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joe Jonas And Sophie Turner Had A Strict Rule To Walking On The Red Carpet Together</a></span></p><p>In another report by Page Six, sources claim that Jonas was unhappy in the relationship and wanted to end it amicably. "Divorce was a last resort for Joe. He never wanted to break up his family, but he had to take what he felt was the best course of action for his girls. An unhappy home isn't a home, and the truth is that he and Sophie were going through it this year."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rumors-painting-sophie-turner-as-a-bad-mom-are-debunked>Rumors Painting Sophie Turner As A Bad Mom Are Debunked</h2><p>After Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner released an official statement about their divorce, the media portrayed Turner in a less favorable light, suggesting she was not fulfilling her role as a mother effectively. According to TMZ, Jonas had taken on the primary responsibility of caring for their children during his tours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sophie-turner-may-have-paid-a-fortune-for-a-live-in-therapist-to-help-battle-her-health-issues.jpg><p>However, as reported by Today, celebrity divorces often mimic real-life divorces in many aspects. Both parties aim to present themselves in a positive light and deflect blame. In this case, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the attempt to portray Joe Jonas as the good dad and Sophie Turner as the party mom backfired</a>, as fans rallied behind Turner, pointing to past interviews that contradicted this narrative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a virtual interview with Conan O'Brien in 2020, Turner revealed that the lockdown was easier for her due to her introverted and homebody nature. She humorously mentioned that Jonas was more of a social butterfly, finding it challenging to stay home.</p><p>Additionally, a TikTok video made by Turner and Jonas in 2020 revealed both of them agreeing that Turner was the one who preferred a home-based lifestyle.

During this period, the family relocated to Atlanta for the shoot, and Turner emphasized that she had to take care of their daughter, Willa, alone due to Jonas’ frequent travel for his work. This arrangement made more sense given her longer stays in one location compared to Jonas’ constant city-to-city touring schedule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-jonas-is-accused-of-putting-all-the-blame-on-sophie-turner-for-their-divorce>Joe Jonas Is Accused Of Putting All The Blame On Sophie Turner For Their Divorce</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Best Life, some online communities hasve chosen to rally behind Sophie Turner</a>.

Another comment sarcastically questioned the need for praise when a father looks after his kids, stating, "Do you want a medal, Joe, for looking after your own kids? SMH."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another user expressed frustration, saying, "Nothing gets me more frustrated than when someone refers to a father as 'babysitting' his own children."
