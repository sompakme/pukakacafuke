His unique look, and his flourishing modeling career helped to catapult him to fame, but in spite of his incredibly striking good looks and his fame and fortune, Fabio struggled to find the perfect lady, and is back<a href=#> in the dating scene </a>once again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fabio, who is now 62-years-old, has played all the dating games for a while, and he now has a full appreciation and understanding for the type of girlfriend he is seeking to spend his time with. He's learned a lot about love and dating, and he's now viewing things differently than he once did. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo </a>reports that the heart-throb is seeking love and is determined to find it.</p><h2 id=he-39-s-still-searching-for-mrs-right><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He's Still Searching For Mrs. Right</span></h2><p>Fabio has definitely had his fair share of ladies, but he has yet to find 'the one.' He has indicated that he does believe that Mrs. Right is out there somewhere, and he's looking forward to finding her, and keeping her! Fabio has some ideas in mind as to what sort of lady would be the one to steal his heart for good - all he has to do now is just find her!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jenny Slate Went On One Of The Strangest Blind Dates In History</a></span></p><h2 id=he-longs-for-his-lost-love><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Longs For His Lost Love</span></h2><p>In spite of being idolized by many, it seems that there was one lady in his life that Fabio just couldn't hold on to. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a> reports on the fact that he was once in love with a woman but he managed to fumble and now he yearns over her. She was definitely <a href=#>'the one that got away,' </a>and this continues to haunt him today. Fabio hasn't revealed much about this woman, other than to say she was a model.</p><h2 id=his-sports-cars-highlight-his-current-dates><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>His Sports Cars Highlight His Current Dates</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone seems to have a special trick up their sleeves when it comes to their date nights, and for Fabio, that 'something' happens to come in the form of luxury cars. He currently owns well over 31 expensive sports cars, luxury cars, and supercars, and he definitely puts them to good use when he's trying to impress the ladies on a date. Fabio's dating game definitely involves some expensive car features!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Heidi Klum Force Her Teenage Daughter Leni Into Modeling?</a></span></p><h2 id=finding-girlfriends-is-easy-for-him><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Finding Girlfriends Is Easy For Him</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he has yet to find 'the one', Fabio has definitely admitted to finding a date pretty easily. In fact, when asked what his dating life was really like, he commented by telling Yahoo News; "There is quantity, but I want quality." Now his fans are well aware of the fact that finding a date is not his issue, but finding a woman to keep for the long run, seems to be where Fabio's dating life stops short.</p><h2 id=he-is-seeking-a-marital-relationship><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Is Seeking A Marital Relationship</span></h2><p>Perhaps one of the most incredible things fans have recently learned about Fabio's love life is the fact that he really wants to settle down and get married. He is seeking a mate to marry and he wants nothing more than to settle down with the love of his life. He has never been married, but that's certainly not for the lack of wanting to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-would-like-to-have-kids><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Would Like To Have Kids</span></h2><p>The 62-year-old star stunned fans when he revealed that in spite of getting on in age, he truly and sincerely wants to be a father. Fabio is obsessed with creating the perfect nuclear family by settling down with someone special and starting a family. When asked about his age being an issue, he disagreed entirely, and continued to be steadfast in his wish to become a dad.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Adam Levine &amp;amp; Other Male Celebs Who Pretty Much Only Date Models</a></span></p><h2 id=his-girlfriends-must-love-the-outdoors><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>His Girlfriends Must Love The Outdoors</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the benefits of seeking love at an older age is the fact that Fabio now has a very firm grasp on what he is looking for in a life partner. One of the many personality traits that he considers to be quite important is the element of the great outdoors. Fabio loves to be outside, immersing himself in nature, so he'll need a lady by his side that can brave the elements and not be afraid of the bugs!</p><h2 id=social-media-obsessed-girlfriends-are-a-firm-39-no-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Social Media Obsessed Girlfriends Are A Firm 'No'</span></h2><p>Fabio has also drawn a clear line as to what he is not willing to accept or tolerate from a new relationship. He is determined to find someone that shares his belief that life is meant to be lived, not documented by a series of selfies and social media posts. He is not a fan, and he doesn't engage on social media at all, so he wouldn't pair well with a lady that is excitable about selfies and sharing her life with others online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-39-s-a-much-better-boyfriend-now-than-ever-before><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He's A Much Better Boyfriend Now Than Ever Before</span></h2><p>The lady love that Fabio unfortunately wasn't able to hold on to is someone he admits to not treating very well. He deeply regrets not being more kind, loving, understanding and accommodating with this woman and knows that he lost her because he treated her badly. He learned from that experience and the lucky lady that dates him next is going to reap the benefits of him being a much better boyfriend now than he ever was before.</p><h2 id=he-believes-in-true-love><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Believes In True Love</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The traditional concept of finding that perfect person and falling truly and madly in love is a dream that Fabio still holds very near and dear to his heart. He really believes in true love and is a true romantic. He is passionate about finding the person that is going to be there for him, and with him, forever.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Robert De Niro Sparks Dating Rumors At The Ripe Age Of 78</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmpqZpMBuuM6vnGakmZuybr7Er5yapJWZeqmx0Z6qZq%2BYlsFutMRmn5qrXam8br%2FAsmSamp%2BqwW6wwK2gp59f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
