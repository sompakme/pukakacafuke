Taylor, present in the stands to support her boyfriend's team, brought along her parents to share in the Christmas Day game.</p><p>As Romo highlighted Travis' 900th career reception, the camera swiftly focused on Taylor, enthusiastically cheering him on. Romo's comment, "And his wife loves it — I mean girlfriend," quickly followed, sparking discussions among fans.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-mtv-awards-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Some Fans Are Convinced Taylor Swift Will Announce A Pregnancy In 2024 ">Some Fans Are Convinced Taylor Swift Will Announce A Pregnancy In 2024</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>There's a growing debate online whether Taylor even wants kids or not, considering how successful her career is at the moment.</p><p>This slip wasn't the first time Romo referred to Taylor as Travis' "wife." During the December 10th game, Romo, a former Dallas Cowboys player, made a similar mistake when Taylor was in attendance. "As you see, Kelce’s wife, Taylor Swift, in the audience," Romo initially remarked when cameras captured Swift in the crowd. He promptly corrected himself, saying, "I’m sorry, girlfriend."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Romo's reference to Swift as Kelce's "wife" has ignited speculation among online observers, with many pondering whether there's a possibility the pair secretly tied the knot or got engaged. Alternatively, it could simply be a well-timed PR maneuver on Romo's part, given the considerable attention it has garnered, or perhaps just a genuine mistake. Whatever is the case, it appears Taylor and Travis are down to keep fans guessing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp6rXZe%2FsMDHnqlmnqWaubR5xKeemp%2BVorKvwIyrrKanoqh6pK3LpaCnn12prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8FuvMCrq2anlmKzornIpbBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
