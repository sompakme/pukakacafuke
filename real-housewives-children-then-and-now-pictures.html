While the<a href=#> Real Housewives of Orange County</a> alum’s kids were small when she started the show in 2012, they had grown leaps and bounds by the time she left four years later. Her eldest children had even started high school.</p><p>In June 2020, the That’s Life alum’s eldest daughter <a href=#>came out as bisexual</a> via Instagram. “I always knew I was bi, I just thought I was bipolar,” the teenager jokingly captioned a social media upload.</p><p>“I love you my beautiful, hilarious, amazing child,” Heather commented on the post. “I am SO proud to be your mother.”</p><p>The New York native exclusively told Us Weekly seven months later that Max had not shared her plans to announce her sexuality ahead of time. “What was kind of funny was <a href=#>we’d never discussed it</a>,” Heather explained in January 2021. “She and I had many conversations about it, but she never said, ‘Guess what? This is the day I’m in to let the world know. … I think she just was at that spot where she was ready. She wanted to live out and open and live her truth.”</p><p>As for <a href=#><strong>Yolanda Hadid</strong></a>, the <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> alum has three kids — daughters <a href=#><strong>Gigi</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Bella</strong></a> and son Anwar.

The Los Angeles native <a href=#>gave birth</a> to her and <a href=#><strong>Zayn Malik</strong></a>’s first child, daughter Khai, in September 2020. “Our baby girl is here, healthy and beautiful,” the former One Direction member tweeted at the time. “To try put into words how I am feeling right now would be an impossible task. The love I feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine and thankful for the life we will have together.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Yolanda called being a grandmother “a whole new feeling” in a January 2021 Instagram post, gushing, “[She fills] a part of my heart I didn’t know existed.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how the Housewives’ children have grown since their reality TV debuts:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkv6aty2afqK2jmsSqwsSsZKShlKh6tbTEp2SappRiu7DDjLBpaW5oboJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
