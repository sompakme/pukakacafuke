According to F4WOnline.com’s Dave Meltzer (via the Wrestling Observer Newsletter), The Young Bucks were originally scheduled to win the IWGP Tag Team Titles in a title for title match with the AEW World Tag Team Titles on the pay-per-view, but those plans got changed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While belts mean less because there are so many of them, there is now a natural push for Young Bucks vs. FTR with four sets of belts at stake and being pushed as a unique match in wrestling history, and could logically be billed as the biggest tag team championship match in history, for that reason.”</p><p>Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler winning a third set of tag titles was certainly a popular decision on Sunday, and many fans were thrilled with the title change. It certainly appears at this point that a third match between FTR and The Young Bucks is inevitable as well</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Royal Rampage, Young Bucks & More Announced For 7/1 AEW Rampage</a></p><p>What do you make of these original plans for Forbidden Door?
