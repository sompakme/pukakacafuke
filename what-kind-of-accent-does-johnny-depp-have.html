It wasn't something that many were used to hearing, and some even accused him of faking his natural way of speaking. Why does his accent sound so strange?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=despite-being-born-in-kentucky-johnny-depp-does-not-have-a-traditional-kentucky-accent>Despite Being Born In Kentucky, Johnny Depp Does Not Have A Traditional Kentucky Accent</h2><p>Johnny Depp was born John Christopher Depp II in Owensboro, Kentucky on June 9th, 1963. He was the youngest of four kids and his parents were of mostly English with some German, Irish, and French ancestry.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Rolling Stones Magazine,</a> Depp claimed that he'd moved more than 40 times in his childhood, but eventually they settled in Miramar, Florida, when he was 7 years old. Between the ages of 17 and 18, he moved to Los Angeles, California, with his band to try and score a record deal. He's also claimed that he might be some Native American, however he's never inquired to either the Cherokee Nation or the Creek Nation, which is something he said his great-grandmother might've been.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This in and of itself clearly does not make any one person Indigenous with no clear way of knowing for sure, and because of this, he'd found criticism from the Native American and Indigenous communities. It also doesn't help that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was the face of Dior's Savauge cologne for a time.</a> As fans have pointed out, it's highly unlikely that these are the sure-fire indicators of where his strange accent could have stemmed from.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Inside The Terrible Year That Destroyed Vanessa Paradis And Johnny Depp's Relationship">Inside The Terrible Year That Destroyed Vanessa Paradis And Johnny Depp's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=some-fans-have-theorized-that-johnny-depp-could-suffer-from-a-speaking-medical-condition>Some Fans Have Theorized That Johnny Depp Could Suffer From A Speaking Medical Condition</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another theory that has been passed around is that Depp could be one of the mere less than 100 people who suffer from FAS (Foreign Accent Syndrome). This is defined in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Journal Of Neurology Neurosurgery, And Psychiatry</a> as an "unusual consequence of structural neurological damage," adding that it "may sometimes represent a functional neurological disorder."</p><p>In layman's terms, it's a medical condition that causes speech disorder, making the afflicted person sound like they're from another country. However, this theory doesn't hold much value, considering there's been no reported medical trauma to Depp's head or neck area that could cause such a disorder to occur. So, it's a nice theory, but we can do better.

He's also perfected Scottish accent for his role as Sir James Matthew Barrie in the film Finding Neverland.</p><p>The actor also spoke and sang in the Cockney accent for Tim Burton's rendition of the Stephen Sondheim musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street. His Boston accent was superb in his role as the infamous gangster Whitey Bulger in the film Black Mass. And who could forget his iconic Scottish Glaswegian accent for his role as The Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Needless to say, he's been perfecting many different accents for a great number of years. It is entirely possible that he simply collects bits and pieces of different accents and combine them to create something as unique as he is.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Angelina Jolie Once Admitted Having A Major Crush On Johnny Depp">Angelina Jolie Once Admitted Having A Major Crush On Johnny Depp</a></span></p><p>Despite what some critics might have to say, he's probably not overacting when he speaks in his natural accent. Whatever it is, and wherever it came from, it's clear that it's just another one of his trademarks, and it's something that younger fans have come to know him by.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYriqusNmpp9lkZiwprrTZpuonaNit7C0zaewZpyVpb1utMCvnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
