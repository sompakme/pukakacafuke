While Jackman has taken to social media to promote the newest 'Deadpool' film and to post a few winter snaps, Furness has remained quiet. The two are looking as though they are still moving forward with their divorce, with sources claiming <a href=#>the only thing to work out is how to split Jackman's net worth amicably</a> between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-hugh-jackman-said-about-his-marriage-to-deborra-lee-furness>What Has Hugh Jackman Said About His Marriage To Deborra-Lee Furness?</h2><h3 id=hugh-jackman-always-spoke-highly-about-his-marriage-to-deborra-lee-furness>Hugh Jackman always spoke highly about his marriage to Deborra-Lee Furness</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar53305173.jpg><p>Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness were married in 1996, and the former couple have two children, Oscar and Ava. Born in Annandale, Australia, on Nov. 30, 1955, Furness is quite a bit older than Jackman. He was born in Sydney, Australia, on Oct. 12, 1968. However, there was never an issue between the two when it came to the age difference that existed.</p><p>Jackman spoke over the years about meeting Deborra-Lee Furness.

I was happy being single," Jackman explained. "I was out of a difficult relationship I'd had through drama school, and it was tumultuous and hard. I'd been living off 120 bucks a week as a student until I was 26. Then, when I met Deb, it was 10 times better than my single life. She was very beautiful. She was unbelievably fun — this energy, this spirit — irrepressible. And she had a confidence in herself. I had a massive crush on her instantly."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hugh-jackman-and-deborra-lee-furness-1.jpg><p>Jackman went on to explain, "She was sort of the opposite of me.
