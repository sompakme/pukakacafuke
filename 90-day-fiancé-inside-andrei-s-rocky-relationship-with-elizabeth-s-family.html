The franchise is known for having <a href=#>a lot of drama</a>, but when this couple came on the show, the drama skyrocketed even more. There has been drama in pretty much every episode that Andrei and Elizabeth have been in. And most of it is because of the feud between Elizabeth's family and Andrei himself that never seems to end. It's understandable that Elizabeth's family were skeptical of Andrei at first, but they still didn't like him even after they met him, especially Elizabeth's siblings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiancé': Elizabeth Agrees With Jenn, Calls Her Husband Andrei 'Aggressive'</a></span></p><p>Elizabeth's dad is starting to like Andrei more now, but her siblings, Rebekah “Becky” Lichtwerch, Jenn “Jaylyn” Davis, and Charlie Potthast, refuse to get along with him. Andrei and Elizabeth have been together for years, but it seems like as time goes on things just keep getting worse between Andrei and Elizabeth's siblings. Here is everything we know about Andrei's relationship with Elizabeth's family.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-rsquo-s-sisters-have-always-been-worried-about-andrei-being-able-to-support-her-and-their-daughter><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Elizabeth’s Sisters Have Always Been Worried About Andrei Being Able To Support Her And Their Daughter</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the very beginning, Elizabeth’s family hasn’t approved of her and Andrei’s relationship. They were skeptical of her dating someone from another country and when she got pregnant, they were even more concerned. It costs money to raise a child and it caused a lot of tension in the family when the couple had to rely on Elizabeth’s father, Chuck, for money. During an episode of 90 Day Fiancé, Becky told Elizabeth, “Andrei knows that he doesn’t want the family so intertwined and involved in you raising a kid, but at the same time, you’re relying on dad for money. So when you rely on someone for money, they’re gonna be involved.” Jenn also told Elizabeth that Andrei has to “step up” since they have a child to think about now.</p><h2 id=chuck-thought-andrei-was-ldquo-irresponsible-rdquo-at-first><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Chuck Thought Andrei Was “Irresponsible” At First</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Elizabeth and Andrei had to rely on her dad when they had their daughter, he wasn’t happy about it. He’s always supportive of his daughter, but he didn’t like that Andrei got Elizabeth pregnant without any plan to support her and their daughter financially. Chuck told the producers on 90 Day Fiancé, “I was really shocked when Elizabeth told me she was pregnant. You could have knocked me over with a feather. Just because he came over here, got married, and then knocked up my daughter without any plan in place to support her. I just think that’s irresponsible.”</p><h2 id=elizabeth-and-andrei-didn-rsquo-t-let-her-family-in-the-delivery-room-when-she-gave-birth-to-their-daughter><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Elizabeth And Andrei Didn’t Let Her Family In The Delivery Room When She Gave Birth To Their Daughter</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elizabeth’s family wasn’t happy that she got pregnant before Andrei got a job, but they still want to be a part of their daughter’s life. So it hurt them when Elizabeth and Andrei decided not to have them in the delivery room when Eleanor was born. During another episode of 90 Day Fiancé, Elizabeth said, “we didn’t want any family in the room because of the stuff that’s happened with my family.” It’s understandable the couple didn’t want everybody fighting when their daughter was born, but it caused more problems since they wanted to be there when she came into the world.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-rsquo-s-siblings-weren-rsquo-t-happy-with-their-dad-paying-for-her-and-andrei-rsquo-s-second-wedding><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Elizabeth’s Siblings Weren’t Happy With Their Dad Paying For Her And Andrei’s Second Wedding</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Elizabeth’s dad has helped her and Andrei a lot</a>. Chuck has been making sure they have enough money to raise their daughter and has been helping Andrei get a job. On top of that, he paid for the second wedding they had in Andrei’s home country. Elizabeth’s siblings definitely weren’t happy about it. In one episode, Jenn questioned Andrei about finances. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She asked him where they were going to get "$15 thousand"</a> in order to pay for the Moldova wedding. Andrei was not happy about this, and he responded angrily. Elizabeth's mom had to step in to stop the fight from escalating. Although Elizabeth’s family never really liked Andrei, the second wedding made things even worse and caused more problems between them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiancé': Jenn Criticizes Libby And Andrei's Reception, Fans Call Her 'Miserable'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-cursed-out-andrei-at-the-second-wedding-in-front-of-the-whole-family><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Charlie Cursed Out Andrei At The Second Wedding (In Front Of The Whole Family)</strong></span></h2><p>The second wedding was meant to bring the whole family together, but the exact opposite happened. Instead of Andrei’s family coming together with Elizabeth’s family, Elizabeth’s family fought with Andrei the whole time. Elizabeth’s brother, Charlie, fought with Andrei the most though. He got drunk and cursed out Andrei while he was giving his speech at the wedding. Charlie and his sisters made it really clear that they hate that their dad helped pay for the wedding. Although Chuck eventually warmed up to Andrei, Elizabeth’s siblings can’t seem to stop hating him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiancé': Libby's Brother Isn't Going To Back Down After Brawl With Andrei</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chuck-hiring-andrei-broke-the-family-apart><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Chuck Hiring Andrei Broke The Family Apart</strong></span></h2><p>After the second wedding, Chuck started to like Andrei more over time since he was showing how much he wants to work and support his family. At first, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrei asked Chuck for money</a>, but Chuck wasn’t going to give him more money for nothing, so he hired Andrei to help with his real estate business. Chuck has a business flipping houses and now Andrei gets paid to help him. But that ended up tearing the entire family apart. Elizabeth and her siblings work for their dad’s business, so when Andrei became a part of the business, Elizabeth's siblings got really angry and jealous. They didn’t want Andrei to take any money that they’re supposed to get from the business. The family gets into a fight pretty much every time they see each other now and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to change anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>90 Day Fiance: The Ups And Downs In Elizabeth And Andrei's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaWWUlsZussiapZydXZa7pb7EomSepJmvrqOx06Fkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZuurrXLsmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
