The model hasn’t been linked to anyone romantically since their (latest) break-up last year. That is, until reports began floating this month that <a href=#>she's involved with Leonardo DiCaprio</a>.The Titanic actor has been publicly single for less than a month after revealing his break-up with Camila Morrone. But things are reportedly heating up between him and Gigi. However, given the timing of their romance, many people are convinced that Leo and Gigi are just one big publicity stunt – here’s why.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Complete History Of Selena Gomez's Ex-Boyfriends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dating-gigi-hadid-could-help-improve-leonardo-dicaprio-s-reputation>Dating Gigi Hadid Could Help Improve Leonardo DiCaprio's Reputation</h2><p>Over the years, Leonardo has gained himself a reputation for dating women 25-years-old or younger. Even as he ages, the women he dates are usually in their early to mid-20s. The Internet went into a frenzy about his break-up with Camila, which came shortly after she turned 25. The pair had a big age difference between them. Leonardo is 47-years-old, making him 22-years older than her. Despite the age gap, they were together for four years.</p><p>However, <a href=#>many memes began popping up</a>, joking that Camila’s age was the reason they broke up (since she’s now “too old” for him). But amid the jokes, Leo has also received criticism for being creepy. Some have even accused him of grooming young women – he first met Camila when she was 11 years old through her step-dad, Al Pacino.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, this is why folks think Leo dating Gigi is a big PR stunt. The Victoria’s Secret model is slightly older than the women Leo usually dates, as she’s 27-years-old. There have also been sources who emphasize that he likes her maturity.</p><p>" <a href=#>He really likes that she has</a> her life together," one insider said. "She has a child and she's mature. He wants to be with someone who has the same idea of good causes and political views like he does."</p><p>Gigi is by no means old, and she’s considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. But by dating someone slightly older than his average romantic interests, it’s possible that Leonardo is trying to do some damage control amid the fallout after his break-up with Camila.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Matt Smith Before He Became Daemon Targaryen?</a></span></p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-has-been-reportedly-into-her-for-a-long-time>Leonardo DiCaprio Has Been Reportedly Into Her For A Long Time</h2><p>Despite the theories surrounding their relationship, Leonardo has reportedly been interested in Gigi for some time. One source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> the Blood Diamond star "always had a soft spot" for her. “He thinks she's beautiful, of course, but also a wise and cool character who's got a very cultured and educated take on life," they continued.</p><p>Similarly, a source told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a> that Leonardo and Gigi have known of each other for some time: "They sort of run in the same high profile circles and would see each other at events, clubs, restaurants and gatherings.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[He] is taken with Gigi," the insider added.

They’re super attracted to each other,” they explained. “She is exactly his type: gorgeous, sexy but low-key with a one-of-the-guys attitude.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But <a href=#>Gigi may not have been interested</a> in the actor at first. At the start of September, one source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> she wasn’t reciprocating feelings. "Leo does have his sights set on Gigi, but she hasn’t shown an interest,” they explained. “They’re friends, but she doesn’t want to be romantic with [him] right now.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Little Known Secrets From Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson’s Relationship</a></span></p><p>However, after spending one-on-one time together, it appears she caught feelings, as reports say the two are officially dating.</p><p>Still, it appears they may be taking things slow. One report says that Gigi isn’t interested in getting too serious with Leo, especially after her break-up with Zayn (which came after he got into a domestic dispute with her mother, Yolanda Hadid). “<a href=#>Gigi is having fun with it</a>,” another source says. “She is not interested in anything serious.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leo, too, is said to be proceeding with caution despite initiating the romance. “He likes her, but things are still new,” one source commented. “He has also been hanging out with his guy friends since his split from Cami.”</p><p>As of now, it appears Leo has not met Gigi’s daughter, Khai. The model reportedly has an amicable relationship with her daughter’s father – they recently celebrated the toddler’s 2nd birthday together. But Zayn may not be adjusting to her new romance, as reports have pointed out he <a href=#>recently unfollowed her on Instagram</a>.</p><p>While sources claim that Leonardo and Gigi’s connection is real, there are still some fans who remain skeptical that it’s authentic. Given the context, dating Gigi could be explained as a PR stunt. But given that Leo has a thing for young models, she’s exactly his type.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWcmryvrdGdpmacmZiusb7IqGSgoZeeeqmtw6KbrGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6onnPq2SsrKWjwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
