It was previously scheduled to take place at The Colosseum at Caesar’s Palace. Sources told the publication Adele will have full creative control over the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Amber Heard Lied About Donating Divorce Settlement</a></span></p><p>Adele originally announced the postponement of her residency in January, though the <a href=#>reasons behind the derailment have been contentious</a>.</p><p>At first, the singer shared a video to Instagram in which she blamed pandemic-related concerns for the delay, explaining her team had been “absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid.”</p><p>However, a source later told <a href=#>TMZ</a> hinted that the issues ran deeper, noting Adele was “displeased” with the production and there were various “disputes.” Adele was “unhappy with various set pieces, a choir, the sound system, and other items associated with the show,” the insider alleged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A different source echoed similar sentiments to <a href=#>Page Six</a>, claiming the singer was unclear of the direction the entire production was taking.</p><p>“There was no real clarity around what Adele wanted for the show because of the endless changes being made to the production,” the source said. “It seemed that while she has always preferred a stripped-back performance, she was under some pressure to come up with a huge extravaganza.”</p><p>Full creative control may be what drew Adele to shift the residency to Zappos Theatre. But the fact that the theatre can accommodate more people likely also played a part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TMZ notes that Zappos Theatre can hold up to 7,000 people, which pales in comparison to The Colosseum’s 4,100 seats. Sources told the outlet Adele will receive a large portion of ticket sales, which means she’s likely set to make more than during her original residency.</p><p>In January, <a href=#>Woman and Home</a> reported <a href=#>Adele was set to make close to $700,000 per show</a> during the original residency. With two shows a week for 12 weeks, the singer was set to make over $16 million. This figure is likely higher now since she can accommodate a bigger audience.</p><p>No official dates have been released for the new residency. But TMZ says Adele’s team aims to have it up by the summer and will wrap up by the end of the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kailyn Lowry Dropped $200,000 To Fight Briana DeJesus</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a>, <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>Woman and Home</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSupbHLnmSnnadiuaK%2FjK%2BcoJmjYr%2Bmv8idnKebqWLHorzPqKpmrJiarrW%2BxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
