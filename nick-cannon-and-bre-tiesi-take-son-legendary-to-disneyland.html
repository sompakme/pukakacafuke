The Netflix star, Cannon and Legendary donned matching denim outfits for the occasion.</p><p>In addition to Legendary, Cannon — who kissed Tiesi on the forehead in one clip from their Disneyland outing — shares 11 other children with five women. He is the father of twins Monroe and Moroccan, 12, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></a>, sons Golden Sagon, 6, and Rise Messiah, 9 months, and daughter Powerful Queen, 2, with <a href=#><strong>Brittany Bell</strong></a>, twins Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir, 2, and daughter Beautiful Zeppelin, 7 months, with <a href=#><strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong></a>, daughter Onyx Ice, 9 months, with <a href=#><strong>LaNisha Cole</strong></a> and daughter Halo Marie, 6 months, with <a href=#><strong>Alyssa Scott</strong></a>. (Cannon and Scott’s first child together, <a href=#>son Zen</a>, died of a brain tumor at 5 months old in December 2021.)</p><p>The All That alum’s <a href=#>large brood</a> has made him the target of jokes and criticism at times, but Tiesi has repeatedly defended her unconventional relationship with Cannon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nick-Cannon-and-Bre-Tiesi-Celebrate-Son-Legendary-Love-s-1st-Birthday-at-Disneyland-5.png><p>“Him and I have [dated] on-and-off for years,” she told E! News’ Daily Pop in March 2022, two months after confirming that she and Channon were expecting their first child together. “I’ve always come back.”</p><p>She continued: “I just <a href=#>respect and love who he is</a> so much as a person, that when I thought about, ‘Do I want my son to be this person? Look at your characteristics, look at your personality, look at how you treat people.’ That’s what is so much more important to me than anything. And he treats me amazing, so that’s all I look at.”</p><p>More recently, Tiesi revealed that she and the Drumline actor <a href=#>don’t have a “set schedule”</a> when it comes to coparenting.</p><p>“So, here’s the thing that I know everyone wants to argue with me about — but he makes his own schedule. He can show up every day, when he stops [in] from work. He can come at night,” she explained during an interview with Entertainment Tonight on Monday, June 26. “We don’t have to plan things, but he’s very present and he’s at anything and everything I ask him to be at. So, I’m very happy. He’s <a href=#>very supportive</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last month, Cannon surprised Tiesi with a new car and a balloon display for her 32nd birthday.</p><p>“Yesterday was just WOW. I was firm in not celebrating this year, but daddy had other plans, even from Ireland,” Tiesi wrote via her Instagram Story at the time. “I still can’t believe what I woke up to!!! @nickcannon I have no words. I had to just sit here and stare at it, and cry with ledgy. You go above and beyond! We love you so much!!! If I didn’t already feel like a bad bitch, I definitely do now!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZOgeqStzaemp2WRo7FurtGeZK2hlai2bsDApJxmq5%2Bjeq2xxp6lnZmirnq1u4ydoKymla65orrDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
