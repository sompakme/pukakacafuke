But for us, who grew up where we grew up, it wasn’t that big of a deal! From when I was very young, my family would be like, ‘Jennifer’s got a [big butt].’ I was endowed in that area.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jennifer-lopez-workout.jpg><p>Starting her career as a Fly Girl on In Living Color, JLo has always been fit — though she’s arguably in the best shape of her life at 49. “It’s crazy,” David Kirsch, one of her trainers, told Us in July 2018. “Like the most amazing bottle of wine, she gets better with time and that is just the truth. Her skin is flawless. Her body is flawless.”</p><p>The Shades of Blue actress works hard to keep it that way. <a href=# rel=noopener>Her workouts</a> are non-stop, high-energy sweat sessions of continuous movement (think: plank to side plank to medicine ball toss to lunge). “The workouts are my express workouts. There is no rest, there is no, we’ll grab a quick breath chatting in between, but that’s how we do it,” Kirsch, who is the fitness and wellness curator at CORE: Club in New York City, told Us. “The workouts are very focused and the eating is very focused… She’s very mindful of her body being this beautiful temple and really respecting it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/JLo-Arod-1.jpg><p>For the past year and a half, the star — whom Kirsch says “doesn’t drink” — has been dating former New York Yankees slugger, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a>. And she told the mag she credits social media for lessening the intense scrutiny she received during her romances with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sean “Diddy” Combs</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a> in the late ’90s and early ’00s. “Now people get to see that this guy they thought was this hard-nosed athlete is, like, a goofy dad who loves his kids and celebrates his girlfriend,” she says.</p><p>Something else the World of Dance judge believes is improving, albeit slowly: the treatment of women in Hollywood. “It has taken time,” she says, “but I think we’re in a very powerful moment where women are going, ‘Wait a minute. We’re not afraid to say what we deserve.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WajqKiVr3q0rdisZKGdomKvqrOMm6ytrF2srrR5z6uYoquVmXqjxYyhnKtloKqys8DOZqmim5GjeqetzKKjsmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
