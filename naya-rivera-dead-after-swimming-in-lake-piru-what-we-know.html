The pair, who wed in July 2014, <a href=#>surprised fans with their decision to tie the knot</a> just three months after her <a href=#>split</a> from <a href=#><strong>Big Sean</strong></a>. (Rivera and the 32-year-old rapper called off their engagement in April 2014.)</p><p>The Step Up: High Water star later revealed in her 2016 memoir that she briefly dated Dorsey, 36, before she met Sean.</p><p>“By the time we sort of reconnected, I was like, gosh, there’s a reason why you keep coming back in my life and we keep coming back together,” Rivera wrote of Dorsey in her 2016 book, Sorry Not Sorry.</p><p>Rivera and Dorsey’s marriage nearly came to an end in November 2016 when she filed for divorce. While <a href=#>they later reconciled</a>, their relationship hit another rough patch in November 2017 when Rivera was arrested after an alleged altercation with Dorsey. After the<a href=#> actress subsequently filed for divorce for the second time</a>, the domestic battery charges against her were dropped as Dorsey decided not to press charges.</p><p>While<a href=#> their divorce was finalized in June 2018,</a> the twosome continued to coparent Josey.
