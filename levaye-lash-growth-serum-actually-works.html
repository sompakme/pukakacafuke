One of our first places to look is usually the list of ingredients, but in this instance, it’s the reviews which convinced Us to take the plunge. Self-proclaimed skeptics who took a chance on this serum say they’re truly shocked by the results received from regular use. Not only does it reportedly work, it does so in a jiffy! One reviewer claims they noticed their lashes improving in just two weeks, which is record speed in our eyes. With that level of progress, we can only imagine how far your lashes can go in two, three or four months!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LeVaye Cosmetics Show Lash Eyelash Serum</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$65</a> at Amazon!

In terms of directions, you apply the serum once per day like you would a liquid eyeliner — and each bottle is designed to last up to four months. Conveniently, this is the precise time it takes for the formula to demonstrate its maximum potential. That’s an excellent detail to remember, because when you’re spending a nice chunk of change on an item like a lash serum, you don’t want to worry about making a repeat purchase a few weeks later. With that in mind, this could ultimately be a bang-for-your-buck serum which accomplishes what it sets out to do.
